</div><h1>And so it begins....</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-9038679908111508353" itemprop="description articleBody">
<br/>Hello out there! Greetings from the beautiful Guatemala City! <br/><br/>Here I am, sitting at a computer in a different country. I've literally been smiling for the last half hour straight, because I've been reading your emails! <br/>I basically have no idea where to start. I'll give you all a run down of my life over the last week, and then give some other useful info... <br/><br/><u>Airport Experience</u><br/>So it was pretty tough saying goodbye to the family. It's all for good things though. Last week was filled with lasts, I guess, and this week was filled with firsts! I met up with come other missionaries in SLC all going to the Guatemala MTC. The flight to LA went well. I sat on an aisle seat right next to another missionary on the other aisle seat. We talked and stuff... I opened the letters you all gave me, including Dan´s awesome little present. :) Somehow I made it through reading those without crying... In LA we met up with more missionaries going to the Guatemala MTC. So there were about 20ish of us total, about 6 hermanas. I slept as best I could on the plane. We landed in Guatemala City about 5am. We got our bags, and all of us got all our bags! It was crazy! I thought for sure my bags were gonna be lost! haha Oh, and on the plane from LA X to GUA I opened Dan's other letter :) <div>
<br/><u>First Day at the MTC</u><br/>So we took an actually pretty nice bus to the MTC. The traffic here is crazy though! I saw tons of people riding on the back of buses, and I saw 7 people fit into a taxi the size of a Fiat!!! We got to the MTC and got assigned our rooms and districts. Between all of us that came we were split into two districts. We all do stuff all together all the time though. I met with Presidente Morris. He is really cool, and super funny! Some people made me get a haircut, so that was harsh. My hair is pretty darn short now! We were able to take a nap, so I definitely did that! So out of everyone I came here with not any of them are going to Cobán. Although, I met some Elders here that are going to my mission, but speaking Q´eqchi´ so that's kinda cool. And my companion is Elder Lapicola! He is from Minnesota. He is really funny! I feel like we work well together.<br/></div>
<div>
<u>6/23</u><br/>We got our Spanish study material today, and started studying Spanish! Its seriously a ton of stuff, but thankfully we have assigned classrooms so we can leave our stuff in there! We met with the Branch Presidency here, and Presidente Hill is the only American one, and he gave a way cool devotional to us! <br/><u>6/24</u><br/>We had a cool gift of tongues lesson. During language study we went outside and practiced talking to each other. I actually was able to say more than I thought I could say!! We learned and worked on praying in Spanish and me and Elder Lapicola taught our first lesson... in Spanish. It was pretty rough, which is to be expected.<br/><u>6/25 </u><br/>More language study... obviously. Our second lesson went way better than the first one! We both bore super strong testimonies! It was way cool. <br/><u>6/26</u><br/>Sunday! It was a much needed break from Spanish. We had tons of devotionals. They were great! Elder Lapicola and I were able to pass the sacrament to our branch, so that was cool. The way they do sacrament meeting here is everyone is suppose to have a talk prepared, because anybody can be called on right before they speak to give their talk. I hope that makes sense... Anyways, I had a talk ready and I wasn´t asked to speak. We had a district class that went really well, and all the companionships in our district taught a little lesson. Ours went well.<br/><u>6/27</u><br/>It was definitely the hardest day so far. Our 3rd lesson went well. I bought a cool homemade tie from a guy that works here. It was only $10! I will send pics when I can. (more on that later)<br/><u>6/28</u><br/>Good day today. 4th lesson went well. Running out of time to write so sorry!!<br/><u>TODAY! </u><br/>This morning we went to the temple. It was great! We´re writing now, and we can go and take pics around the temple and go to the distribution center later!</div>
<div>
<br/><u>A few more things:</u><br/>Cameras are only allowed to be used on P-Days, and we can´t send any pics from the MTC, so in a few weeks you'll all be barraged with pics!<br/>I´m doing well with everything. I'm happy and having a good time. My companion is good, and my district is great! We´re all basically best friends.<br/>I pray for the fam every single day!<br/>I´m working on memorizing a bunch of stuff in Spanish like the missionary purpose the first vision, etc...<br/>It turns out that I was suppose to bring hangers, so I´ve just left my shirts and stuff folded this whole time. I just have to iron my shirt every day! I'm gonna buy some today...<br/>I´m gonna buy stuff in Spanish like scriptures, etc from the distribution center today.<br/>There is an elder here named Elder Godi who is really cool and has helped me with stuff and he looks exactly like Brother Elkins!<br/>It's most definitely not hot here. Outside its really nice, and inside I´m actually almost always cold!<br/>I love you all! Sorry to all who I couldn´t respond to today! Until next week!<br/>Love,<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

Hello out there!<div>
<br/>I can't believe it, but I have less than a week until I leave the CCM! Holy smokes where has the time gone? I have no idea where I will be emailing from next week! I leave next Tuesday early in the morning. I don't know when the next time I'll write, so yeah...</div>
<div>
<br/>This week was pretty good! Sorry for the minimal details, but we basically do the same exact stuff every single day, so its hard to pick highlights.<br/><u><br/></u></div>
<div>
<u>7/20 P-Day</u>We went to the temple, and it was great! Later we went to the Distribution Center and I picked up some stuff I needed. We walked to a really cool store, and it was basically a super tiny walmart. It was really cool! I bought some skittles. Oh man they were good! I sent a postcard to the fam, so hopefully that gets there! And I worked on making a scripture marking system.<br/><u><br/></u></div>
<div>
<u>7/21</u>I ran 2 miles for our deportes time. It was alright. I don't really enjoy running... haha I finished my scripture marking system, and made a key and everything! It is so awesome! I'll send a pic of my system when I can!<br/><u><br/></u></div>
<div>
<u>7</u><u>/22</u></div>
<div>
ONE MONTH DOWN! Its crazy I can't believe that I've been here for a whole month! I had a really good personal study time! I love personal study!<br/><u><br/></u></div>
<div>
<u>7/23</u>Good day. Good deportes. Good spanish.<br/><u><br/></u></div>
<div>
<u>7/24</u>We started off our Sunday with a good personal study session. Sacrament meeting was great, and I wasn't called on to speak. The nurse here gave us all a health presentation and stuff. I took good notes. haha We had a couple more devotionals. I love watching the devotionals, they're always so spiritual!<br/><u><br/></u></div>
<div>
<u>7/25</u>We went to the Immigration Office to get Visa stuff worked out. All we did was sign a couple things and get a our pictures taken. It was really easy. Good personal study.<br/><u><br/></u></div>
<div>
<u>7/26</u>Another just all around good day. Good spanish, good study, we had a great devotional. <br/><br/>So yeah, I'm doing well here. I love my teachers, I love my companion, I love my district, I usually love the food, and I love the language. My spanish has obviously improved over the last few weeks, thanks to a lot of prayer and the gift of tounges. I love you all, and I hope you all have a fantastic week!</div>

<br/>
Hello all!<br/>
<br/>
After today I only have one P-Day left here in the CCM! Crazy! This week was pretty great!<br/>
<br/>
<u>7/12</u><br/>
We were able to leave the CCM for a couple hours! We drove out to the center of Guatemala City. We toured a super cool Catholic Cathedral, and went to a super cool market. I bought a little notebook, postcard, and the coolest tie ever! Its was great! Then we went to the Plaza and handed out BoMs! It was cool, because even though my Spanish isn't great, I was able to talk with the people. Then we went to Wendy's for lunch! It was amazing! <br/>
<u>7/13</u><br/>
All the new peoples came in today. The CCM is so crowded now! I learned some Q'eqchi'...<br/>
<u>7/14</u><br/>
I picked up my personalized scripture cases! They're awesome! They are green and blue, and have my name and mission on them! I'll send pics when I can!<br/>
<u>7/15</u><br/>
Lots of practice teaching. Good times as a district.<br/>
<u>7/16</u><br/>
We got a new investigator, and I wrote a new talk.<br/>
<u>7/17</u><br/>
Good sacrament meeting, and I wasn't called to talk. We had a bunch of SUPER spiritual devotionals!<br/>
<u>7/18</u><br/>
I talked with an Elder from Cobán, so that was cool. We did some practice with some new people and it showed me how far I've come in Spanish!<br/>
<u>7/19</u><br/>
We watched a super awesome devotional by Elder Holland, and then had an amazing district meeting. I felt the Spirit so strong!<br/>
<br/>
I know thats not a ton of detail, but I feel like there is never enough time! I am doing well. I am learning more and more every day. I am so grateful for the gospel. I know that this church is true, and I know that through Heavenly Father's plan our families can be together forever. That knowledge has been helping me so much lately!<br/>
<br/>
I love and miss you all!<br/>

<br/>
Hey there everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
I'm officially halfway through my CCM experience! Its crazy! It seems like I've been here for forever, but its gone by so fast!</div>
<div>
<br/>
So this week went well:<br/>
<u>7/6 - P-Day</u><br/>
I bought colorful scripture cases and a sweet Chelsea jersey from the little Tienda that comes here everyweek. An Elder who I room with sprained his ankle playing volleyball.<br/>
<u>7/7</u><br/>
I had good studies and me and Elder Lapicola taught a good lesson. We got our fancy filter-water-bottles. And we got our official debit cards. <br/>
<u>7/8</u><br/>
I discovered that I can memorize scriptures really well when I draw them out. I will have to send pics when I can, but they are really cool! We had our first weekly planning session and it was really cool!<br/>
<u>7/9</u><br/>
We studied a lot today. An Elder from a different district gave me a haircut and it looks great! <br/>
<u>7/10 - Sunday</u><br/>
Sundays here in the CCM are the best! We get to relax a bit and learn a lot about the gospel, in English! We had a good district class and we played some games together. It was really fun. Our district is becoming really close! I was able to spend some time at the piano, so that was fantastic! I have been wanting to play for so long and I practiced some hymns and such. It was great! At snack time I got a butterfinger. It was fabulous! We watched two old Provo MTC devotionals, one by Elder Scott and one by Elder Christofferson. They both were amazing! They talked about exactly what I needed to hear! I was asked to share a bit about missionary influences in my life for our district meeting. I talked about some BoM prophets and about Nate, David Blake and Amanda. It was awesome! I could feel the spirit so strong! I am so grateful for all the awesome missionary influences in my life!<br/>
<u>7/11</u><br/>
No slurpees for me... oh well haha. I had a super fun time playing basketball for our exercise time. Elder Lapicola and I taught one of the best lessons we've taught so far! It was great! We practiced meeting people and giving them Books of Mormon. We had to say goodbye to all the Latinos and North Americans that left this morning. It was hard, becuase I've become such good friends with them! Tomorrow about 65 new North Americans are suppose to be coming in! Its gonna be nuts!<br/>
<br/>
I am loving it here in Guatemala! I am learning so much! My spanish is coming... I can't wait to get out into the field! I love you all!<br/>

</div><h1>What a week!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-8322716889814543186" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello to all those not at the MTC here in Guatemala!<br/>
<br/>
I am running out of time, so I'll try to fit in all I can!<br/>
<div>
<br/>
So this week went well. I will give more details about stuff here at the MTC, known as the CCM here. My day consists of basketball or volleyball in the morning, lots of language study throughout the day, three meals fit in there, and a lesson or two for our investigators. The food here is pretty good! We have a mix of Central American food and 'American' food. My bowels are still getting used to everything, so yeah... </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Spanish is coming along. I most definitely know more now than I did two weeks ago! I can actually say more than I ever think I can. Thanks to the Spirit! </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
My companion is pretty funny. We teach well together, and work well together. The CCM is pretty small. There are about 1/3 north Americans or Norte's and the rest Latinos. We eat meals with the Latinos and talk with them and it helps my Spanish a ton! </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
I've had a lot of spiritual experiences this week! I'm loving it here! Oh, and my district is awesome! We've all become really close! Next week I'll be writing on Tuesday, so keep that in mind! <br/>
<br/>
I'm out of time! Have a great week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

</div><h1>A Birthday to Remember</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-1243193897882604751" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hey everyone!<div>
<br/>This week has been pretty great! I've learned a ton and grown a ton too! My Spanish is getting better and better everyday. Its still hard to understand everything, but its getting better... I am getting used to life here. The showers are still cold, but it helps when I sing hymns to myself. I don't have a ton of time left and I want to talk about my birthday, so sorry about the little details...</div>
<div>
<br/>This week I have learned a lot through my studies. I love studying! I am reading in the BoM and also I got ahold of a couple Liahonas in English, so thats been awesome! I went on enchanges with Elder Lagunes. He came with me and we taught in my area and it went great! He is such a great, simple teacher and he is super personable, so the people love him. I learned so much from him! We're working hard and doing well! Alan wasn't baptized this week, because he still doesn't have permission from his mom, but I trust in the Lord's timing. It will happen when it's suppose to happen.</div>
<div>
<br/>So for my birthday, I started the day by opening the box of goodies the Fam sent to me while I was in the CCM. I saved most of the stuff for my birthday! So I opened that and enjoyed that. I also opened the watch I bought myself a few weeks ago. Studies went great and during studies the Hermanas stopped by and gave me a poster they made. Hna. Barrios stopped by too and gave me a little piece of cake, a little chocolate milk and a baby snickers. It was fun :) After lunch we went and contacted a less-active member. It was great! Then we hiked up to Chi-Ixim. We got up there and couldn't find an investigator. I took some sick pics. Then we decided to keep hiking 'deeper' into the mountains. We talked with a family on the way there and ended up going to their house. They live in a small village! We taught them and it went well. We decided to play soccer with some boys. It was super fun! Afterwards they invited us to eat dinner with them! We ate some super good food and had an authentic traditional Mayan drink. Basically the entie village was there talking with us! It was super awesome to get to know so many people and establish trust with them! We ended up getting a ride back down the mountain the back of a pick-up truck! It was so cool! We got back to Tactic and went to talk to an investigator. He wasn't home... So we went and picked up my shoe from the guy who fixed it (the heel fell off a few days ago...). Then we went to the Fam. Barrios house and they threw a suprise party for me! I had no idea! Fam. Barrios, the Hermanas and Elder Paris did a great job planning! So we had a super tasty dinner and a super tasty cake. And of course, I had to have my face shoved into the cake... Luckily Hna. Fuller didn't do a great job in smashing my face into the cake, so it wasn't a super big mess :) It was such an awesome day! I had so much fun! The Lord definitely was watching out for me! I was thinking of Dad too and wished him a happy birthday too :)</div>
<div>
<br/>Oh, and on sunday was the Branch Conference. The choir we were in performed and we did great! We sang a couple primary songs for the opening hymn. For the closing hymn we sang Abide With Me 'Tis Evening Tide. I played the piano for that one and I nailed it! Not one mistake! yay! The Lord, and Grandma Smith were definitely helping!</div>
<div>
<br/>So yeah, good week, good birthday! I am loving it out here! I wish you all a fantastic week!<br/></div>

</div><h1>2 Months Down!!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-4246379759582871856" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hey everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Things are going well here! I am so sorry but I have almost no time left! This will be quick!<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
So this week went well in the grand scheme of things. There were hard parts and good parts. I had my first district meeting, and it went really well. I've been practicing and playing the piano a ton! Its great! I learned the hymn Abide With Me 'Tis Evening Tide to help with the choir here. It sounds great! Oh, and I also found out that Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing is a hymn in the Q'eqchi' hymn book! I have been working on my own little version of Come Thou Fount and its really cool! Alan is set to be baptized this Saturday! We could use your prayers on his behalf! We had to change the date for Moises, so he will be baptized in September.<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
The food is good here! We are always stopping at Panaderias, bakeries, and getting bread and other break related stuff. Its so good, and super cheap! A little more info about my comp: He and I work well together. Obviously we have our differences, but we have worked them out :) He teaches really well, and we are learning every day how to teach better together. He only has 5 months on the mission, and right now he is training and district leader for the first time, so its been hard for him. My patience has been tested, but we are going great! <br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
I love studying every morning! We never have enough time to study! I am reading the BOM, and also studying other stuff. I LOVE studying the Gospel. It helps me feel better, and there is so much good stuff! I love finding little nuggets of inspiration, or different ways of seeing things. Its great!"<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
This week we did some cool service. We helped a family move cinder blocks! It was great because a few of our investigators were helping too! It was so hard! We had to carry them about 100 or more yards each trip! I could only carry one at a time, and it was hard. I sang hymns to myself the whole time and that helped :) After about 20 or so trips we finished.<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
So yeah, I'm doing well. Thanks for your prayers! I am still adjusting, but I love it here! I love and miss you all! I pray for you every day! Don't forget to pray for Alan please! Have a fantastic week!<br/>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>
Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>Life is Good!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-6127737124815079611" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hey everyone!<br/><br/><div>
How are things back in the states? So this week I am just going to give a super quick run down of what happened, and focus more on life here in Guatemala!<br/></div>
<div>
So heres a brief summary of my week! On P-Day we went to Coban and played soccer with other missionaries.´We met a guy who is a tailor, and he is super cool. We had a zone meeting, and it was awesome! I learned so much! And then I went on splits with the zone leader. He is Elder Smart, and is actually from Draper! We talked about so much stuff, and it helped a ton to talk about that stuff, and talk in English! Its rained a lot this week. There is a place we go contacting that is basically just the side of the mountain, so we've been hiking! Its so much fun! I've participated in a couple Priesthood blessings so far, but I gave on this week in Spanish of course! It was pretty awesome! Church went well, and things are going well! We have two guys with baptisimal dates, Alan and Moises! They are both set to be baptized on the 27th! Please pray for them!<br/></div>
<div>
Now for the other good stuff! So the food here is great! I haven't come across something that I didn't like. Yeah there is some stuff that isn't very good, but its all been pretty good! My body is adjusting to it well too. We go to the Branch Presidents house almost every day and we pay his wife to cook us lunch! Its great! The people here are great, the memebers especially! They are so strong! The people are really nice! We take busses every where! The only way we can get around is by foot or bus. Our area is pretty big, so the bus it is! They are basically just big vans... Its fun! The climate here is amazing! Its actually a bit cold in during the nights and in the morning! It doesn't ever get too hot. It rains a lot and the lightning storms are frequent, and magnificent! I'm adjusting to everything pretty well! There are somethings that are harder to adjust to than others, like the cold showers... But bit by bit I've been able to adjust. I know that through Jesus Christ anything is possible. Through Him I've been able to find peace when I'm homesick. Through Him we can live with our families for eternity, and that is what keeps me going! <br/></div>
<div>
I love you all and miss you all so much! I am so grateful for your prayers, and I hope you feel my prayers and my love!<br/>Love,<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>Greetings from Tactic!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-5047507853756009116" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello world!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
It has been way too long since I've heard from you all! And I will get to the good stuff first because I know you are all wondering.<br/>
<br/>
My first area is called Tactic! Remember it like a TicTac, but switched. It is about 40 minutes, by bus, outside of Coban. Its in the mountains here, and its beautiful! My trainer's name is Elder Paris. He is from Santiago Chile, and actually has heard of David Blake! He has been out on the mission for five months. We work well together. We are still getting used to teaching with each other, but that's the way it goes. <br/>
<br/>
So this is how my last 12 or so days have gone:<br/>
<u><br/></u></div>
<div>
<u>7/27</u><br/>
We went to the temple. The last time I'll be able to go for a while! We took pics as a district. I drew a card for one of my CCM teachers. I also drew and wrote notes for everyone in my district.<br/>
<u><br/></u></div>
<div>
<u>7/28</u><br/>
I got the package mom sent via the Reeds! Thanks to the Reeds for doing that for me! It was full of everything I was wanting! Yay!<br/>
<u><br/></u></div>
<div>
<u>7/29</u><br/>
We had a couple different workshops about missionary saftey and stuff. Me and Elder Lapicola taught our last lesson in the CCM! I was able to play my We Thank Thee O God For a Prophet song that was in the package. It was great!<br/>
<u><br/></u></div>
<div>
<u>7/30</u><br/>
We had the last day in the classroom! We gave our cards to our teachers!<br/>
<u><br/></u></div>
<div>
<u>7/31</u><br/>
I made some cool PMG Lesson Scripture reference cards. They are cool. Sacrament meeting was great as always. We watched a video about Joseph Smith and the Restoration. It was SO spiritual! I had my final interview. Our district meeting went really well! I really came to love all the missionaries in my district at the CCM! We had a really cool and spiritual last devotional with Presidente and Hermana Morris!<br/>
<u><br/></u></div>
<div>
<u>8/1</u><br/>
We just had workshops all day about mission stuff. It was really long and boring... We got our travel plans. I finished up packing, and said good bye to everyone! It was sad, but yeah.<br/>
<u><br/></u></div>
<div>
<u>8/2</u><br/>
We woke up really early and left. I went to Coban in a bus with about 12 other missionaries. Most of them were the Q'eqchi' elders, and they are all my friends so it was good. We got to Coban and met a ton of people. I met Elder Paris, and met with Presidente Faundez. Presidente Faundez wants every missionary to learn English, Spanish, and Q'eqchi'. Good thing I alrealy have one of those down! Haha We had lunch then left to Tactic. We took a bus there, and it was cool. We got to our place, and it is pretty big! It is pretty nice for the area, but its not what I'm used to... We planned for the rest of the day, went to the store to buy food, went contacting, got back and planned, had dinner, unpacked, and went to bed.<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
<u>8/3</u><br/>
I woke up colder than I thought I'd be... It gets pretty cold here at night because its in the mountains! I had a nice steamy shower. Of course my body was producing the steam, because the water was so cold! Haha We had a good study time. We took a bus to Purulha and found a family, taught a family, and taught Alan. Alan is pretty close to baptism! We had a choir practice at the church. Its was good to meet some of the youth here!<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
*Going into speed mode here because of lack of time*<br/>
<u>8/4</u><br/>
Went to Tamahu. We taught a lot! We had a cool experience with a prayer being answered. We ended up riding home in the back of someone's pick up truck, because we missed the last bus!<br/>
<u><br/></u></div>
<div>
<u>8/5</u><br/>
Went to Pasmolon. Taught a couple good lessons. We went to the Elders Quorum activity, and it was really awesome! We had a spiritual devotional, then had some great food!<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
<u>8/6</u><br/>
I studied about peace, and it helped a ton. We went and cleaned the church. We went to Purulha again, and set a baptismal date for Alan for the 27th of August! We had a good time making dinner and watching the crazy lightning storm! </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
<u>8/7</u><br/>
Church went really well. I bore my testimony, and was strengthened by others testimonies. We did a bunch of stuff that we needed to, and taught a couple lessons. We had a really great dinner after fasting. I snacked on Ritz and peanut butter too :)<br/>
<br/>
All in all its been pretty good. Its been hard adjusting to everything here, but I am doing well. I am praying more than I ever have. I have cried more in the last two weeks than I have in the last two years! Haha I love you all and miss you all too! Remeber that through the plan of salvation we can all live with our families for eternity! I love you!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>Hey where'd this giant fence come from? We had a master plan!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-3858074498670893854" itemprop="description articleBody">
<br/>
Hey everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
So the fence wasn't actually that big, and our plan wasn't that masterfull, but we really were trying to contact an area, and were cut off by a fence... haha<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
Well once again, I'm sitting here thinking of what to tell you all! I had a pretty good week! Seriously things with Elder Funez are so great! We get along really well, and he is so cool and chill. He is great! Plus he has the same birthday as me!! Thats crazy! He also studied psycology for two years before the mish, so he knows when something isn't right with me. It is actually really nice, he asks me how I'm doing and we talk and it helps :) Oh, and this week I had 7 hot showers. And every single one was glorious! haha Seven weeks of cold showers gets to you! <br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
This week I will answer some questions mom asked me, and maybe some other little tidbits :)</div>
<div>
<br/>
Are you healthy?<br/>
Yes, I am. My leg is 99% better. I really don't know what the problem was, so you can all stop asking :P haha Every once in a while I'll eat something that makes my stomach hurt a bit, but over all, I am doing well health wise.</div>
<div>
<br/>
What is your favorite food you’ve been eating?<br/>
My favorite food is made by Hermana Anabella Barrios. She cooks lunch for us almost every day! Everything she makes is great, but they make super awesome homemade flour tortillas and fill them with refried black beans, scrabled eggs, and cream. Oh man, they are so good! </div>
<div>
<br/>
How's life with your comp?<br/>
Things are going great with him! Refer to the first paragraph of this letter if you have any further inquiries :P</div>
<div>
<br/>
How are your pants? Keeping you cool/dry in the humidity?<br/>
The golf pants are the way to go for sure! They are cool, and when it rains they dry quickly! Really it isn't too humid here, so yeah...</div>
<div>
<br/>
How are your shoes?<br/>
My brown ones are the best! They are waterproof, which is obviously awesome! The black ones are less awesome. The heels of both black ones have fallen off... Luckily I've gotten them fixed. I am looking to buying some new black ones here soon. In Cobán there are lots of places where I can buy shoes, so don't worry about sending any...</div>
<div>
<br/>
Are you bothered by any insects or rodents?<br/>
Where I'm at the bugs aren't bad, both in the area and the house. There are some little bugs that are little cockroaches that are annoying, oh and lots and lots of spiders. Basically now if I see a little spider I just leave it. If I see a big spider I spray it with our spider killer. And there haven't been any rodent problems at all. So yeah...</div>
<div>
<br/>
Does is rain every day? Is it a cold/hard rain or kind of like a cool mist?<br/>
Yes it rains everyday, if not super close to every day. The rain depends, but it usually isn't too hard, but sometimes yes it pours! In the mornings it is usually clear, then clouds up in the afternoon, rains, then stops. The climate here is fabulous! It is really cool, unless the sun is beating down. Aparently it will get colder here in Nov and Dec! I have to sleep with two blankets, and long pants and long sleeve shirt! Its great!<br/>
<br/>
I hope that answers some questions! Haha I just want to share some things really quick. Alma 34:41 is good. I can't remember what it is right now, but I have it written down to tell you guys about it. haha A few quotes: "Happiness is the purpose and design of existence." -David O. McKay. "Its not the will to win that matters. Everyone has that. Its the will to prepare to win that matters." -Paul "Bear" Bryant, saw that one on the back of someone's shirt. "Don't count the days. Make the days count." Muhammad Ali. Those quotes I've been thinking about lately. They are all really great! My favorite one is from President McKay. I really believe that happiness is important. The plan of salvation is also called the plan of happiness for a reason. I really am trying to be happy. I pray that you all can be happy. I am working really hard to help others become more happy! Happiness is the best!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well I hope you all have a wonderful week! Plus enjoy conference this weekend! Its gonna be great! I am so excited! :D </div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

</div><h1>Real letter from 9/19</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-3555223275412833592" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hey everyone!!!<div>
<br/>I am so happy to be able to write this week! My stomach is fine, and my leg is better, so all is good! I have a new companion! His name is Elder Funez. He is from Honduras. He is 21, and has 17 months on the mission! He is so awesome! He teaches well, he is super funny, and we work well together. He is way more relaxed, in a good way. I feel a lot better with him! He is so awesome! Plus he looks like Uncle Allen :)</div>
<div>
<br/>Well these last two weeks have gone well. I am doing well out here! I am getting better at Spanish. Almost every single gringo out here says I'm doing really well with Spanish. Its easier to see progress in other people, so I trust them! My body is doing well and all that. I am happy, especially when we are out working! I am half way through Alma in my BoM reading! I started when I got here in Tactic and am trying to finish by October 25th!!! <br/><br/>Well I am gonna spend some time this letter to talk about the area, and the people. :) The area is doing well. Our branch is pretty great! The members are strong, and we visit the less active members a ton! Right now our investigators are Alan, Moises, Angel, Cristobal, Fam. Bin-Mateo, Gonzalo, to mention a few :) They are all doing well. Alan and Moises are getting close to baptism. Alan has a new date of Oct. 8. Please keep him in your prayers! His mom still won't let him get baptized... We are going to try to set dates with Angel and Fam. Bin-Mateo this week! Our teaching pool is really big! We are trying to work with the members to get tons of new referrals, so we are gonna be working even harder here in a few weeks!!! The names of the places we contact are the following: Tamahu, Purulha (h's silent), Pasmolon, and Tactic. In Tactic there are further divisions: Tactic, Chamche, Las Magnolias, San Juan, Chi-Ixim, and Xi-Ayi (x's sound like sh). We take busses to the far away places, and walk everywhere! Its great! There are little thrift clothing stores everywhere, called Pacas! They are pretty cool. We look for ties all the time! I can't remember if I have mentioned this, but the other day I bought 3 ties for Q5 each, which is like $0.75. So yeah, I bought a few ties for 75 cents each! Stuff is cheaper here obviously. Like I bought a super sick FC Barcelona jersey for Q35, which is $5. An Hermana just bought some Beats headphones for Q200, which is like $30. Yeah, crazy! The food here is good! Yesterday was the first time I had something that I didn't like. Luckily the Hermana told me that if I didn't like it that I didn't have to finish it! Apparently the distaste was visable... haha oh well. You can't win 'em all!  Truely I am still learning how to best do these letters. I super hope that you all are getting the feel for whats going on, and I hope I am writing enough (mom and dad...)! I feel like I am writing plenty... haha So yeah, bear with me. I am still pretty fresh out here. But at least I'm not the newest batch anymore! 6 or 7 new missionaries came in this week and our district got two of them! Oh, plus we are gonna do district t-shirts! Each companionship is gonna come up with a design and present it at the next district meeting. I attatched a pic of my idea. Today I showed it to some of the peeps in our district and they all said they were gonna stop thinking of designs because they liked mine so much. :) Sorry for the jumbledness of this letter. But hey its probably one of the longest letters I've written!! </div>
<div>
<br/>I love you all and I miss you! I am getting more adjusted here, so the missing factor is getting eased :) Oh, plus today we bought a new showerhead heater thing, so I'M GONNA HAVE A HOT SHOWER TOMORROW!!!</div>
<div>

<br/>Hello everyone!<br/><br/>So this week was good. I am super sad, because today has been filled with doctors visits and there won't be time to write. I really wish I could read all your letters and respond to them, but like I said, no time. I have been having some problems with my leg and my comp. is pretty sick himself. But alls well :) This week I'll get a new companion! His name is Elder Funez, he is super cool. I haven't really talked to him much, but I know he'll be a great comp! Plus I think he looks a lot like Uncle Allen! Haha I love and miss you all! I can't wait to read your letters and reply to them next week! :D<br/><br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley

Hello family, friends, and anyone else who stumbles upon this letter!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Sorry, this week's letter is gonna be a bit short. I am a bit sick right now, and don't feel super great... So yeah.</div>
<div>
This week was a meh week. I can't really say much else. Its just we didn't get a lot of work done. I feel like we could have worked harder and found/taught more people. I need to take this week and make next week even better! </div>
<div>
A few highlights that I can think of are: A member taught us how to make flour tortillas! It was so much fun! I really stink at making them, but I will practice so I can make them when I get home! We had a Multi-Zone meeting. It went really well! Presidente Faundez taught a great lesson on obedience! </div>
<div>
I am doing well out here! Life is good, especially when I live each day with a smile on my face and a song in my heart!</div>
<div>
I love you all, and hope you all have a great week!</div>
<div>
Love,<br/>
Elder Kelley</div>

Well here we are again. Its great! How are y'all?<br/>
<br/>
<div>
The subject has a bit to do with my week. I'll get to that a bit later :) As for me I'm doing well. I finished my training as a new missionary. We are finishing this change tomorrow. I passed my four month mark on Saturday so thats kinda cool!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well here is the big news of the week, and where the subject comes into play. I'm being transferred! I'm gonna go to Cobán and work in the office of the mission as a Financiero! Yep, I'm gonna be a Finance Elder... </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
That's not all though, the crazy thing is that Elder Funez is being transferred too, as well as the Hermanas here in Tactic. So they're cleaning out all of Tactic! Its pretty crazy! And it's not because we weren't getting anything done, it's just what needed to happen I guess... </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
But anyways, more on my transfer. The way that the office works is that the new elder gets trained on how to do everything for his job, then trains a new elder. The training is 2 changes, or 3 months. So that means that I'm gonna be in the office, in the same area, for 6 months! I'm not super happy about that, but its where the Lord needs me right now. My comp is gonna be Elder Vargas, and he is pretty cool. I will be serving in the Cobán 2 Ward. There are three wards in Cobán, so it'll be cool to work in a ward! There is a little back story too. There are two zones in the mission that have Q'eqchi' elders. The general area is called Polochik. The thing is that they cleaned out 5 or 6 areas up there too, because of disobedience. I had been working on Q'eqchi', and I told Presidente Faundez and the APs that I wanted to go to Polochik, so I was pretty sure I was gonna be called there! But alas, I was called to the office... I'm still not sure about the whole office thing, but thats natural. Humans are afraid of change. Oh, and the office elders have their P-Days on Thursdays! So I will get two P-Days this week! Haha </div>
<div>
<br/>
Oh a more spiritual vibe, I finished reading the Book of Mormon this morning! I started when I got in the field and I finished in my training! Yep, I read the whole thing in 3 months! It was super awesome reading it so fast, because I was able to make sense all the stories and histories better! And of course I did as Moroni directs in Moroni 10 :) I hope you all know that I know the Book of Mormon is true. It really is the word of God. I love it! Plus I've been thinking about this quote this week. It is from President Monson's April 2016 Priesthood session talk. This talk is one of the best of all time in my eyes. Heres the quote: "Remember who you are and what God expects youto become. You are a child of promise. You are a man of might. You are a son of God." Isn't that just awesome!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well this week I went on divisions with the Zone Leaders. I went with Elder Nelson. He is super cool, and knows Q'eqchi'. He was able to help me out with some language stuff and translated prayer stuff and my testimony into Q'eqchi'. So I've been working on memorizing that stuff. I want to share the small amount of my testimony I have memorized in Q'eqchi': Ninnaw naq li Dios a'an li qaChaxahil aj Rahonel. Ninnaw naj yo'yo' li Dios ut li ralal li Jesukristo. Ninnaw lix Hu Laj Mormon a'an li raatin li Dios. Well there it is! Have fun trying to pronounce that! Its really fun, but hard too! Haha</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well I'm happy and having fun out here! Its great to hear that alls well with you guys! I hope you all have one heck of a week! Its gonna be a good one! Can't wait to hear from you on Thursday! haha</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

Well this week was a different one. We had a ton of District Leader stuff to attend to. But we were able to give service, and witness a baptism among other things! Here are the details on a few things that happened:<br/></div>
<div>
On Monday I bought some cool corte fabric. On Tuesday I got the help of a member to make myself a case for my missionary planner! It didn't really turn out how I was thinking, but it'll do. :P We had divisions this week. I stayed here in Tactic with Elder Leon. He is newer than I am, so I was the senior companion!!! It was kinda weird, and hard to take the lead in lessons, but it all turned out well! </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
We were able to give service to the Fam. Barrios this week. We helped paint their kitchen! We painted it pink. The paint was super watery, and they didn't care if the paint got on their concrete floor, so it was a different painting experience than in the US! haha On Friday we spent basically the entire day in Santa Cruz. Elder Funez interviewed 2 investigators of the Hermanas there. Then on Saturday we were able to go to their baptism! Elder Funez and I witnessed the baptism. It was just really cool to see a baptism out here! We have a baptismal date for Hna. Irma and her son Kevin for the 29th of October! We are trying to put new dates for Angel and Cristobal for in November. Please keep them all in your prayers!!! :) Well that is about all I have to say. Its not much, because not much happened this week... Oh and I saw a guy wearing a Jr. Jazz jersey the other day! It was great! The clothes thrift stores here are called pacas, and they basically have just a ton of clothes from the US, so I'm sure he just picked it up in a paca! haha <br/></div>
<div>
This week I've studied in 3rd Nephi. Its been awesome of course! I've almost completed my goal of reading the Book of Mormon in my first 12 weeks! I also read over Elder Holland's April 2016 talk. I found a super cool part in his talk. He says, "My brothers and sisters, the first great commandment of all eternity is to love God with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength—that’s the first great commandment. But the first great truth of all eternity is that God loves us with all of His heart, might, mind, and strength. That love is the foundation stone of eternity, and it should be the foundation stone of our daily life. Indeed it is only with that reassurance burning in our soul that we can have the confidence to keep trying to improve, keep seeking forgiveness for our sins, and keep extending that grace to our neighbor.<br/><br/>President George Q. Cannon once taught: “No matter how serious the trial, how deep the distress, how great the affliction, [God] will never desert us. He never has, and He never will. He cannot do it. It is not His character [to do so]. … He will [always] stand by us. We may pass through the fiery furnace; we may pass through deep waters; but we shall not be consumed nor overwhelmed. We shall emerge from all these trials and difficulties the better and purer for them.” It was just really cool to read that part about God loving us, and then how God will never desert us. Cool stuff. <br/><br/>Well I'm doing well out here. My Spanish is coming along. I'm happy, I'm healthy. I am learning more every day. I wish you all the bestest of weeks! I hope you find something to make you happy! <br/><br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

Hello out there!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Well Trev, you should be honored, because something you wrote made it into the subject line today! I almost loled when I read it! Haha Its great!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well once again I'm sitting here trying to think what to say. This week wasn't super great... It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good... Saturday I was feeling kinda down, so I kneeled down and asked for help. After the prayer I stood up, changed my attitude, and I had a good day. Its all in the attitude! And of course with help from Heavenly Father :)</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well I'm just gonna tell of a few good experiences this week.<br/>
This week we went up to Chi-Alli three or four times. It is the little village that is an hour up a mountain. It kills me every time. The last time up I told Elder Funez that if we hiked up there everyday it wouldn't be so bad. He just laughed. haha We have a pretty great investigator up there! Her name is Irma. She is super ready! She just moved to Chi-Alli from Cobán, and she has hardly anything. She has a house and her little family, and thats about it. We are helping her out to find a mattress she can have so she and her three little kids don't have to sleep on the floor. She is super humble, and ready. </div>
<div>
<br/>
This week when we taught Angel and Cristobal I felt good. We were talking about the Word of Wisdom, and it was good because of the spanish. I was able to understand everything that they said, and I was able to answer their questions and participate in the lesson really well. So that felt really good! The gift of tongues is real! </div>
<div>
<br/>
Saturday we did a "service project" for National Service Day. Really we just went to the church and helped prep for the birthday party for Hermano Caal and his son. It was fun! We helped blow up balloons. Then Elder Funez and I had a race to see who could start a fire the fastest. I won :P We started the fires and used charcoal to help cook. Elder Funez, one of Hermana Caal's older sons, and I cooked the meat and potatoes on the fire grills. We talked and ate and it was a great time! </div>
<div>
<br/>
Today for our "p-day activity" we played frisbee!!!!!!!!! We played with a few companionships in our zone, and we played on the indoor soccer field we always play on. We were about 10 all together, so we had a nice 5 on 5 game! To start was a little rough, because Latinos are better with their feet than their hands... haha After a few minutes everyone got the hang of it! Luckily other than me, there were three other gringos that could play :P It was seriously so much fun! I've missed frisbee so much! Of course I played well and everyone was freaking out that I was so good! It was nice to be good at the sport we play. When we play soccer they're all super better than I am! Haha </div>
<div>
<br/>
I was reading about prayer this week and came across Enos 1:4. I looked at the footnotes and that is when my mind began to be blown. Footnote A is attatched to 'hungered'. The scriptures that are linked to it tell us what we should hunger for and what blessings we can receive from it. Footnote C is linked to another cool scripture about prayer. If you have some time, please look this scripture and footnotes up. It is super cool!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well thats all I really have to share with you guys today! I really hope its enough! Please, tell me if it isn't enough, and I'll try to include more :) And really if any of you out there have any questions, shoot me an email! I love hearing from you guys each week! This week is gonna be a good one! I only say that because I'm gonna make it a good week! Haha I think some of you by now have realized that I've come up with a little quote I like to say at the end of these letters. Here it is: Be happy. Stay creative. There it is! I truely mean that! I value happiness and creativity! Well have a fantastic week! </div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
This week was great! It was pretty slow, just because I was looking forward to conference so much! So yeah, good week. I won't go into more detail of the week, because I have so much to say about conference!!</div>
<div>
<br/>
I was able to watch every single session of conference, and each one in English!! It was seriously so freaking awesome! I was looking forward to it more than normal! haha I loved all the talks! I especially loved Elder Hales' talk and President Nelson's talk! Their talks on love and joy were basically what I needed to hear, so they were great! President Monson bore short, but VERY powerful testimonies. All day on Saturday I was really looking forward to hearing from him, longing to hear from him basically. At the end of the Priesthood session he spoke. As soon as he started speaking I was filled with the Spirit. I don't know how to describe the feeling, other than I felt a strong burning in my heart and peace in my mind. It was more incredible than I can describe. Just like in the Priesthood session in April, he used a WWII story. Once again, the story made me understand the importance of his message. I think President Monson shares stories about the war because he served in the war instead of serving a mission. I think it is his form of a mission. I don't know, that thought just barely came to my mind, so yeah. But then President Monson started the Sunday session off with another fantastic talk. It makes me sad to see him in the condition he is in. It just makes me pray for him harder! I want you all to know that I know that President Thomas S. Monson is God's prophet on the earth today. I love and sustain him with all my heart. I know he has been called of God. Elder Nattress gave a super great talk too! Basically the whole time he spoke I thought of mom and the great things she has taught me. I think other than the experience with President Monson, that was when I felt the Spirit the most. Mom, you're the best!! </div>
<div>
<br/>
Well this week in my studies I learned a lot too! I finished Alma in my reading! I really love Alma 56:47-48! It talks about mothers again!! I also read Elders Holland and Nelson's talks from October 2015. They talked about mothers and righteous women respectively. I reflected on the blessings that have come from Mom and Manda. Those talks are seriously so great! I don't know why so much has come up about mothers and righteous women recently, but its really helped me appreciate their influence on me! I also read the memoriams of Elders Packer, Perry, and Scott. I learned a lot about their lives, and also re-learned of some of their teachings! I really miss those great Apostles! <br/>
<br/>
So basically this week has been one of learning! I have learned so much and felt the Spirit in equal magnitude! Life is good out here in Tactic, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala! Haha I feel good, I'm healthy, I have hot showers :P My comp. is good, we are teaching lots and have baptisimal dates for this month! </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
The other day at our Zone Meeting some of the Hermanas told me something funny. They told me that I am visibly happier. With Elder Funez I've been able to be myself more, and be more loose. I didn't think that a change like that was noticable. Now that I think of it though, I really do feel happier with Elder Funez. That isn't putting down Elder París at all. We worked well together. But Elder Funez and I work GREAT together! So yeah. Life is good. I'm happy. Oh, and I got a little birthday package from the fam! Its a bit late, but better late than never! :P It was filled with goodies and notes! Also a frisbee! Just holding the frisbee makes me fell happy! haha Next week we are planning on playing as a district!!! I love you all and hope you enjoyed conference! We are really blessed to have a living prophet and apostles! Have a super fantastic week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

</div><h1>Happy Thanksgiving!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-192502182155397821" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hey Happy Thanksgiving!<br/><br/><div>
I hope you are all doing well! As for myself, I'm doing well too! This week has been a pretty slow week. In the office I've really just been working on the new logo, and a mission Christmas card! They are both turning out really well! Other than that, there isn't much else to talk about... I know thats kinda boring and all but I'm gonna try to hit some points, and also some questions Mom asked me. So here it goes!<br/></div>
<div>
This week I've started to listen to Christmas music. I can't remember if I've mentioned that yet, but yeah. I figured that Christmas here isn't gonna feel super Christmasy, so I need to get into the Christmas Spirit now! haha This week the weather turned really cold. Like we wake up freezing and are cold all day. Even with my sweater and all, its still surprisingly cold. #Wasn'tPreparedForThis But I'm making it! The down side is that I got sick yesterday. So I've got a cold right now... The worst part is the cough. I always get gnarly coughs when I get colds... Meh, but I'm makin' it! </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
This week a senior couple entered the mission! They are the Calls. They are super cool, and super humble too! We've been helping them with bank and money stuff and all. Its sad though, because he is going to serve as Brach President in Rabinal, which is about 3 hours away from here, so we won't see them a lot. But the funny thing is that one of their daughters is Whitney from Studio C!! Crazy! What are the odds! haha And when we were talking with them one day, she FaceTimed them! Small world :) </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Sorry not much Spiritual stuff this week. I was reading a cool talk, but I forgot it at home, so I don't have any quotes to share from it. But I will just back up what I said last week... 2 Nephi 2:25 is seriously so great. So is President Nelson's General Conference talk from this past conference. I seriously seek happiness and joy with my heart. I know that Jesus Christ is the source of this happiness and joy, so we should all strive to follow him, and listen to His words.</div>
<div>
<br/>Well thats what I got this week. I hope you all enjoy your Thanksgiving! Find stuff to be grateful for! I know that I sure have a ton of stuff to be grateful for! I love and miss you all! Have a fantastic week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>
<div>
<br/>p.s. I hit my 5 month mark this week! Crazy!</div>

</div><h1>Well this is awkward. Two weeks in a row of lame subjects.</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-1400941888985692471" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hey all you people, hey all you people, hey all you people, won't you listen to me?!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Props to everyone who gets that reference. :P Well this week has been one for the record books. Literally. On Monday and Tuesday the entire mission was gathered here in Cobán for a meeting. Never before had all the mission been together in one spot before! So that gives a nice intro to what I'll write next!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Our area president, Elder Duncan, came and talked to us on Tuesday. Tuesday for almost 6 hours, he talked with us. All he did was answer our questions, and give us tips on how to manage our time. It was seriously fantastic! The thing that I liked the most was actually what his wife said. In her broken spanish she explained the power of love and happiness in the gospel. It was great! </div>
<div>
<br/>
During the week I came across a talk by President Uchtdorf given in the Relief Society session of the October 2008 conference. I bet you can tell why I liked it because of its title: Happiness, Your Heritage. It is seriously so great! It talks about happiness and creation. He also talks about how creating and being compassionate help us achieve God's happiness. I almost underlined and marked the whole thing, but one of my favorite quotes from it is this,"The more you trust and rely on the Spirit, the greater your capacity to create." Like wow. I have never linked creativity with the Spirit before. That has been something I've needed lately with creating the new mission logo. This week Presidente Faundez gave me a little curve ball, and totally re-directed the course of the logo. I've been having a super hard time trying to arrange everything he wants into a professional and attractive logo. Anyways, I've been praying for help with it, so hopefully as I rely on the Spirit in that aspect, I will find a way to figure it out :) Anyways, you should all read that talk. It is fantastic. </div>
<div>
<br/>
Sorry I don't have much to write this week. It was a pretty crazy week. I don't have much time left either, so yeah. I am doing well here in the office. I am still not loving it, but at least I get to design stuff :) I hope you all are doing well. I hope you all have a wonderful week too. Enjoy your Thanksgiving. Enjoy next Tuesday too, because its my five month mark! haha </div>

Love ya!<br/>

</div><h1>I can't think of a good subject this week... Sorry</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7973351922481375589" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hi people!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Another week in the books! It was generally an uneventful week in the office. Well at least I can't remember anything amazing happening... I'm just gonna share some of the more eventful stuff that happened. :D</div>
<div>
<br/>
The other day we decided to go exploring. There is this part of our area that we didn't know was ours or not, but we still went there. We walked for a while, and found a little patch of houses. But these houses were really big and really nice. It was weird because we were kinda in the middle of nowhere on this dirt road, and found all these nice houses. Then we kept walking up the road, and found a little aldea (village)! We were able to contact a few new families from our little adventure! Yay!</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
We got our stove and oven fixed in our house, so we've been baking a lot. I made muffins the other day, and my comp has made brownies like 4 or 5 times :) Plus we actually have a freezer, so I bought ice cream last week. Brownies and ice cream mmmm :) Plus I found some A&amp;W root beer the other day, so I had a root beer float :D </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
I had two little sets of stomach problems this week. It wasn't fun. Both times it was during the night, after having eaten a huge dinner... I just need to remember to not eat so much! But its so hard when the food is so good! haha But I'm all good now :)</div>
<div>
<br/>
On Tuesday night we were contacting, and some lady let us into her house, and she was watching the election stuff. It was funny. Then on Wednesday morning our taxi driver couldn't stop talking about Trump winning. The whole thing was really funny. I don't know why... Maybe its just that we aren't in the US and the people here are still freakin out about it! haha </div>
<div>
Last Friday, the 4th was my comp's birthday! He turned 27! I don't know if I've mentioned this, but yeah, he is the oldest Elder in the mission... It was fun. We had a few birthday celebrations with missionaries and members. I hope you like the pic of him with cake all over his face! It was super funny! haha </div>
<div>
<br/>
This week I've been working on mission logos in my free time. I've been able to come up with a solid ideas, especially the ones I sent. Its kinda hard to design stuff when I don't have access to my normal font library, but I made it work with some Google Font stuff. I know at least one of you will understand what I'm talking about ;) #DesignProbs </div>
<div>
<br/>
Well thats all I can really think of right now... I didn't have much time to study this week, so I don't have any profound thoughts or scriptures for you this week... Well I've got one scripture, and I found a quote from President Monson too. Here is the quote, and I'm translating it, so it might not be exact... "Obedience is the price, faith is the power, love is the motive, the Spirit is the key, Christ is the reason." -President Monson. I thought that was super cool. It links all those things into one purpose, Christ. I really like it. The scripture that I've been thinking about lately is 2 Nephi 2:25. I love this,"men are that they might have joy." Dang. That is our purpose. We are here in this life so we can have joy, in this life and the next life. I hope you all know that happiness is really important to me. I want to be happy. I want to have joy. I know that if we follow Heavenly Father's plan, we will be happy in this life and the next. Plus I started reading Our Search For Happiness this morning. :) I'm excited to learn more about being happy! haha </div>
<div>
<br/>
Well I'm doing well here in Cobán. I am trying my best to be my best! I love preaching the good news of the Gospel to people every day! I love and miss you all a ton, but I've got work to do here! Staying busy helps me focus on the work and not be homesick :) Thanks for all your letters this week! I love hearing from you! Have a fantastic week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>
Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>Guess who has visited every bank in Coban....</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-4176223392479474931" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello out there!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Hey everyone! I just want to say that last week was one of the longest weeks I've had as a missionary, but this week has been a lot better! I'm getting the hang of stuff here as a financiero! haha I'll get into my job later in the email!</div>
<div>
<br/>
So yeah, I'm a lot happier than I was last week. I attribute that happiness to two things. One: the sheer fact that I've gotten more used to everything. Two: the things I've learned from my studies this week. I had some good study time this week. We only have about 45 minutes to an hour to do personal study then we go to the office, but the study I've had has been great! I was listening to I'll Go Where You Want Me to Go, and it hit me. I was having a hard time accepting this 'call' to be a fincance elder, and the words of the hymn just really helped. It was kind of a smack upside the head, like Heavenly Father saying, "I know why I put you there, now get to work!" Then I read the works of the hymn Be Thou Humble, "Be thou humble in thy calling, and the Lord thy God shall teach thee." Another wake up call. Obviously I'm suppose to be here for a reason. I haven't figured out why, but I'm trying to look for things that might be the reason... I've learned a lot already from being here in the office. I've been trying to be more humble and willing to learn. Like I said I know I'm here for a reason. I've now accepted the call from the Lord, and I'm willing to work hard here in the office!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Now I'll give a little overview of what we do as finance elders... :D Obviously we deal with the finances of the mission. We record rent payments and such. We reimberse missionaries for things. We record and take care of the expences of Presidente and Hermana Faundez. We pay for busses and food for big event and such. So yeah, theres a lot to be done, recored, payed for, and all that. Our life in the office is kinda like this... We get here to the office at 9am. We do things that need to be done, which usually involves money :P haha Of course it involves money! We have lunch at places close to the office. And we are suppose to leave at 3pm, but its hard to leave on time, because there's always tons to do. We spend the rest of the time in our area! We have a small area, because we don't spend as much time in it. We have a few investigators. We teach a lot of less active and recent converts. We usually visit members too :) The members here are the best! They are super strong, and they give us so much support! We almost always have members to come with us to teach lessons!  They are all super fun and super great! </div>
<div>
<br/>
A few little tidbits... I have access to Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop here in the office! :D I've been talking to Presidente Faundez about redesigning the mission logo! Plus he wants me to design a Christmas card for the missionaries! Its awesome that I have the chance to use my design skills on the mission! Halloween isn't really celebrated here, but they have a Day of the Dead type deal on November 1st. Its called Día de los Santos, like Day of the Saints kinda thing. We have been running in the mornings now! I thought running was so dumb at home, but now when its basically the only form of excercise available, I love it! Running in the mornings helps me clear my head, and relieve stress :) I've been working on my Q'eqchi' this week, and its coming along slowly but surely. Our area President, Elder Duncan is coming to the mission in a few weeks! Its gonna be great! All this financial stuff has gotten to me, and I made myself a little budget sheet in Excell the other day. I'm gonna be keeping track of my finances :P haha </div>
<div>
<br/>
Well thats really all I can think of right now! Its been a good week, and I'm happy!! :D Life is good here in the office! I'm trying my best to be my best! I hope you all have a wonderful week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>
Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>P-Day. Thursday. Jeeves.</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-740077258538519095" itemprop="description articleBody">
Whats goin' down up north?<div>
<br/>Well down south where I'm at things have been pretty different! To start, it is Thursday, and I'm writing. Truth be told, a ton of stuff has happened since Monday! I don't know where to start! Well I kinda do actually :)</div>
<div>
<br/>My new companion is Elder Vargas. He has been in the office as Financiero since I've been here. He has 10 months on the mission. He is 26 years old. He actually graduated from college in psychology before coming on the mission. He is from San Diego. He is actually Mexican, just grew up in California. So he speaks English. And that's kinda been my downfall lately! haha We have to remind each other to speak in Spanish, mainly for my sake. I need to improve my Spanish! </div>
<div>
<br/>Monday was a good P-Day. We played futbol and it was super fun! We visited with Hermana Irma and her son Kevin. We talked with her and gave her little baby a blessing, because he was sick. Then we visited Familia Jul. We had FHE with them just like always. We all just took time to share our testimonies. It was sad and everything because me and Elder Funez were leaving, but it was probably one of the most spiritual experiences I've had on my mission. I came to love Fam. Jul so much in Tactic. They are seriously such great people. I'm gonna miss them a ton! </div>
<div>
<br/>Tuesday we went to the offices in Cobán. I was officially dubbed Financiero 2. It was a pretty crazy day. Lots of people had changes, and plus there had to be 16 trainers there. The 16 new missionaries came in. It was super fun to see my pal Elder Nielson! They had their little entrance presentation, and we as finance elders gave our presentation. After lunch, we just talked for a while. I talked a lot with some of the new guys. For some reason I just loved talking with them! haha I gave them little bits of advice and stuff. It was weird being on the giving end of advice! Another reason why stuff was crazy was that Elder Vargas and I took like a billion taxis to different places to pay for different stuff. Then the bus to take the old missionaries to Guatemala City was late, like 6 hours late... So there were tons of people in the office waiting for stuff. I talked a lot with the guys who were leaving. I love those guys, and seeing them leave made me super baggy. It sucked. I talked more with the new guys, and it was really fun! Then we went to my new house! We live with the pouch elders, who are really the secretaries of the mission. One of them is my first companion, Elder París. </div>
<div>
<br/>Wednesday was a much calmer day. We did our office stuff, and Elder Vargas taught me how to do a bunch of stuff. I actually learned pretty fast! Or thats what he told me, haha. I had a bit of free time in the office, so I organized and 'personalized' my desk. It helped me feel better. We got to go out and do real missionary work! We tried contacting a few families but they weren't home. We talked to a guy, and it went well. Then we went with some members. It was super fun! They are super funny, and super nice! Everyone has told me that the Barrio 2 members are the best! And so far they are! haha </div>
<div>
<br/>Thursday, today, we woke up and cleaned the house. We got some stuff organized in our room, and we changed up some stuff. I made my part my own, and was able to unpack everything. That felt pretty good to get my stuff unpacked, and make my space, my space. So yeah, its been a pretty hectic time, but overall pretty good I guess. </div>
<div>
<br/>So the way that office life works is the following, more or less. We wake up normal, we have just a little bit of time to study, and we have to leave around 8:30 to be in the office by 9. We go somewhere for lunch. We are suppose to leave at 3, but we almost always have stuff to do still. From the time we leave until 9 we are out in our area working. Our area is pretty small, because we aren't spending a ton of time there... We take taxis a lot, because its the safest way to travel when we are carrying a lot of money. Plus we don't have time to walk... </div>
<div>
<br/>So yeah. Lots of stuff. Lots of change. I'm still trying to get used to everything. Well I hope you all have a super awesome week! I can't wait to write to you next Thursday!!!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

Hey everyone!<br/><br/>I sure hope you all had a wonderful Christmas!! I know I did! I'll start with that!<br/><br/>So here they celebrate Christmas more on the 24th. So we did our thing that day. We knew that not many people would be willing to let us in, so we, along with the other elders we live with, went around singing Chrismtas hymns to a ton of people in the ward!!! It was awesome! The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear! haha Its so true! It felt super good to go sing to the people! I was so happy! That night we ate with Fam. Fraatz. They are a well off family, and we had a good little devotional, then had an amazing dinner!!! We had turkey, mashed potatoes, jello salad, rolls, and everything! It was like a classic Christmas dinner!!! It was amazing! And fireworks are a big thing here for the holidays, so we also lit off some fireworks! haha Then on Christmas morning I woke up and opened a couple presents the fam sent me! Church went well. After church the four of us took a little break then ate lunch, then we went to the office to skype our families! The only way I can describe my skype call to the fam is with one word, and I bet you can all guess what that word is. Yep the word is happiness! haha But seriously I've thought about it all week, and I can't put any other words to it! I was so happy to talk to you guys! I was similing literally the entire call! It was amazing to see and talk with you in real time! That was definately the highlight of the day!!!! Dang it was awesome!! haha :D <div>
<br/>Well other than the Christmas festivities, not much has happened. Just normal office missionary life I guess. We did have some killer lessons this week though! We went on divisions with the APs twice this week, and it was great! I was able to share my parts and my thoughts more fluidly and better than I think I have before! We found a couple new people this week, and they are all progressing! One of them is named Cecilia. She has come to church for like the last two weeks, and we were finally able to visit her! She is reading the Book of Mormon, and is already in 2 Nephi!! Pray for her, and for us, so we can do everything we need to so she can come unto Christ and be baptized! </div>
<div>
<br/>Well I guess I need to go into more depth on the whole Tikal trip. Basically it was super mega awesome! The whole thing is way bigger than I thought... There are tons of little (still huge though) temples all over the area. The biggest ones are the coolest though! The actual Tikal temple is dope! We just walked around and had a good time. Me and Elder Escalona are basically best friends now. By the pics I sent, it seems like we're comps! haha</div>
<div>
<br/>Well I'm not sure there is much else to say. I'm sure I'll think of a ton of stuff to say like in an hour... But whatever. I'll get to you guys next week! haha Oh, well I happened to find a super awesome new Christmas tie last week in Petén! It has skiing santas on it! :D haha Plus it was like 2 bucks. Always a bonus. Well I have to go, so until next week! I love you all, and I am happy to hear you all had a great Christmas!!! <br/><br/><br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley<br/><br/><br/>p.s. Bishop Smith sent me a super awesome Christmas story last week, and I want you all to read it too. I will attach a word document, so yeah. Its super powerful and I love it! ¡Gracias Obispo! <div dir="ltr" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px;">

thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall

<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Most
folks in Steelville were just a little bit afraid of Big Sam Edwards.  Sam
had lost his job when the steel plant had cut back, and he hadn’t been able to
find work during the past six months.  He was a proud man; and now, with
Christmas coming, he made a few telephone calls to important people telling
them that he didn’t want any “do-gooders” trying to help his family at
Christmas.  He gruffly warned, “I’ll be staying up on Christmas Eve, and
if anybody comes around trying to leave anything at the door, somebody’s going
to get hurt.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On
Christmas Eve, when his wife Kathryn, and his children had gone to their beds,
Sam sat in his small front room with a shotgun draped across his lap.  He
became so weary that around two o’clock he fell asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The
next morning when he awoke, there in front of him he saw a whole pile of toys,
a large ham, a small Christmas tree, and an open Bible.  For a few
seconds, he felt a surge of joy.  But then he became angry.  To
himself he muttered, “I warned them, and somebody will pay for poking their
nose into my business.”  Just then the children came into the room. 
Seeing the toys, they shouted, “Look, Daddy!  See what Santa left us!”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Sam
jumped from his chair and quickly stepped between the children and the
toys.  “Don’t touch those things!” he shouted.  “This is not our
stuff, and somebody is going to pay for sneaking in here and leaving it. 
That’s breaking and entering, and I’m not going to put up with it.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Sam
went quickly to the telephone and called his long-time friend Sheriff Walt
Durrant.   After several rings the sleepy sheriff picked up the phone. 
Sam blurted out, “Sheriff, you get over here.  Somebody broke into my
house, I want them arrested.”  He hung up.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Sam
looked over to the corner of the room where his children were standing in a
huddle, gazing longingly at the pile of toys.  “You kids get back to bed,”
he said.  They didn’t move, but fixed yearning eyes on their mother, who
stood behind them.  She didn’t know what to do.  During the past few
discouraging months, she had more or less given up on helping Sam.  If she
voiced her thoughts, it always started an argument.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Sam
sternly repeated, “I said get back to bed.  It’s too early for you kids to
be up anyway.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The
children reluctantly retreated.  Kathryn went into the kitchen and started
cooking some oatmeal.  Breakfast might be the best meal they were going to
have that day.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Thirty-five
minutes later, Sheriff Walt Durrant knocked on the door.  “Come in!” Sam
shouted.  The sheriff opened the door and said cheerfully, “Merry
Christmas.”  Sam’s only reply was a look of disgust.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“Now,
what’s happened here?” asked the sheriff.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“Somebody

arrested.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“Well,
Sam, that looks like pretty good stuff to me.  Did they take anything?”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“No,
they didn’t take nothing, but I’m fed up with all of the do-gooders in this
town.  I can take care of myself and my family.  I don’t need help
from nobody.  Besides, didn’t I tell you to keep those meddlers away from
here?”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“Were
you gone away last night when they did it?”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“No,
I was sitting right there in that chair.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“Well,
Sam, you know nobody could have come in here without making a big racket.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Sam,
more angry than ever, replied.  “They might have made a big racket, but I
guess I slept right through it.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“I
guess you did,” the sheriff drawled.  “Funny thing is, when I drove down
your lane from the road, I could see that nobody else had been down here since
the big snow last night.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“Well,
somebody drove or walked in here.  Now you find out who it was.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“I
told you, there’s not a track out there.  The snow quit falling last night
around nine, and nobody has been in here since then.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“Sheriff,
there must be some tracks out there.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“Go
see for yourself, if you think you’re so smart.  See if you can see where
anybody came in here.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“I’ll
show you,” said Sam.  “I don’t know why we pay taxes for a blind sheriff
like you anyway.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Together
the two men went outside.  Sam wandered down the lane searching for some
tracks other than those left by the sheriff, but there were none.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">He
returned to where the sheriff stood.  “Let’s go around the house,” he
said.  “There will be some tracks out back.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Together
they circled the house, but all around it the snow was as smooth as a calm
lake.  Not a mark on it.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Sam,
more irritated than ever, shouted, “Somebody’s raked over the tracks.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“Nonsense,”
said the sheriff, “nobody has been here.  I don’t know where that stuff
came from, but I know this—nobody brought it here.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Sam
didn’t know what else to say or do.  The sheriff spoke as kindly as he
could.  “Look, Sam, I’ve got Christmas waiting at home.  Why don’t
you just take the stuff and enjoy it.  Forget where it came from. 
Just be grateful.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Sam’s
voice was choked with emotion as he replied.  “Sheriff, I’m not grateful
for nothing, except the stuff I provide for my own family.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The
sheriff replied, “I know, Sam.  But you’ll get work soon.  Things
will get better.”  He drove away.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Completely
mystified by what had happened, Sam came back into the house and sat in his
chair.  Kathryn spoke softly.  “Sam, what does it matter how it got
here?  It’s here.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Sam’s
only reply was, “I just can’t figure out how somebody came here without leaving
no tracks.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Little
four-year-old Katie, who was standing nearby with the other children, excitedly
said, “Daddy, maybe there’s some tracks on top of the house.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“I
don’t think so, honey,” Sam replied gently.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Then
it hit him like a light.  Some troublemaker had actually rented a
helicopter and landed on his roof!<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">A
few minutes later Sam propped his old wooden ladder against the side of the
house, and to the amazement of Kathryn and the children he almost ran to the
top.  Up there he looked carefully around.  “Nothing,” he
muttered.  Little Katie called up to him.  “Are there any reindeer
tracks?”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Sam
paused and looked down at her and the other children.  Then he winked at
Kathryn and said with a chuckle, “Yeah, I think I can see some reindeer tracks
over by the chimney.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Suddenly
Sam had a feeling that he had not had in years.  He shouted out, “Well,
what are you kids waiting for?  Those toys are for you, you know!”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Soon
the ham was cooking in the oven.  The children were playing with their
toys.  The miniature Christmas tree was on the table.  Unnoticed by
his family, Sam picked up the open Bible.  A verse was underlined. 
He softly read:  “That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which
seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.”  Never before or since
has more joy been packed into one little house or into one father’s heart than
there was at that moment.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">From
then on and through the years everybody in town knew that Sam had
changed.  During the next thirty-six years almost everyone had been
touched by one of Sam’s kindnesses.  He’d done everything from helping
Arnold Conder build a house to being the chief cook at the annual old folks’
dinner.  On his sixty-eighth birthday he was honored as the city’s most
generous citizen.  Sheriff Durrant, his closest friend, was appointed to
present him the plaque.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Sam
wasn’t much of a public speaker.  As he accepted the award, he awkwardly said,
“I don’t do no more stuff for others than anybody else around this here
town.  I just wish I could do like Jesus said in the Bible.  I wished
I could do something good and do it in secret so nobody would ever know.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">As
the years went by, in almost every conversation he had with Sheriff Durrant he
would say, “You remember, don’t you, Sheriff—that Christmas when there was no
tracks nowhere?  If I could do something good for someone and leave no
tracks, that would be the merriest Christmas of all for me.”  The sheriff
would smile and say, “Maybe someday, Sam.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">All
in the community mourned when Sam’s wife died.  By now the children were
all grown up and married, and had moved to larger cities to get work. 
They and their children visited Sam as often as they could, but most of the
time he was alone.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Now
it was once again Christmas Eve.  Tomorrow Sam’s house would be filled
with his children, his grandchildren, and even his two-week-old
great-grandson.  It was a family tradition for all the family to come home
on Christmas afternoon.  But tonight he was alone.  He would have
gone to visit some friends but his eyesight was such that he could no longer
drive, and his arthritis made walking a lot less than pleasurable.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">At
about five o’clock the Gentrys had come over to sing Sam a Christmas
carol.  They were a young family who during the past summer had moved into
the old Conder home across the hayfield from Sam.  Their two young
children, five-year-old Lexie and three-year-old Ben, had taken a special liking
to Sam, and he to them.  The family made it a point to give Sam a ride to
church every Sunday.  The children loved him to tell them stories about
when he was little.  They and their mom, Marinda Gentry, came to visit him
often.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">This
Christmas Eve tears moistened his cheeks as first Lexie and then Ben hugged him
and said, “We love you, Grandpa Sam.  Merry Christmas.”  Just before
they left to go home he gave Lexie a doll and Ben a ball.  He had wanted
to make each of them something, but his hands were not now his servants as they
had once been.  Sam watched them through his front window as the little
family departed down his driveway toward the country road that led the one
block to their home  A heavy snowfall had begun.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Sam,
who had difficulty in sleeping anyway, had decided to stay up late this
night.  As he prepared for bed he looked out of the window and saw that
the gentle snow had covered all of the fields in the country neighborhood with
a soft smooth whiteness.  The snow by then had stopped falling.  The
winter scene reminded him of that mysterious “trackless” night so long
ago.  As he let his mind wander in a multitude of memories, he was
suddenly jolted back to reality.  Looking out across the field toward the
Gentry house he saw an orange glow.  To his horror he realized that the
Gentry’s house was on fire.  Hurrying from his chair he scooped up a
jacket on his way to the back door.  He quickly climbed the wire fence
that separated his house from the hayfield.  His pains forgotten in his fears
for his friends’ safety, he hurried toward the burning house.  There he
found a group of people standing together near the mailbox.  The fire
truck had just arrived, and the hurrying men were unrolling hoses and
exchanging shouted instructions.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">No
one saw Sam approach, all eyes being on the leaping flames.  Mrs. Gentry
was screaming, “Bennie is still in there!”  The boy’s father shouted,
“I’ll try again!” but two men grabbed him and shouted, “You can’t go
back!  It’s no use!”  Unnoticed by anyone, Sam ran around and entered
through the back door.  He couldn’t see because of the thick smoke but
that didn’t matter because he knew the layout of the house, since he had helped
build it.  Flames were everywhere.  He could feel the heat biting
against him.  The smoke choked his lungs.  Suddenly he heard a faint
cough.  He blindly made his way toward the sound and found little Bennie
lying on the floor.  He scooped the crying child up in his arms and,
running through the flames, made his way to the back door.  Once outside
he held the boy close to his body and looked heavenward.  After coughing
violently for several seconds the child began to cry.  He placed little
Bennie down on the snow and told him to go out front to the mailbox to his
mother.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Now
for the first time Sam could feel the pain.  His lungs seemed to be on
fire and his skin felt as though he had been immersed in boiling water. 
He wanted to be home.  Home was where he wanted to die.  Without
consciously knowing what he was doing, Sam, as if carried by the angles, crossed
the snow-covered field, climbed the fence, and staggered into his home.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">A
fireman found Bennie crying and making his way through the snow.  Soon the
little boy was in the arms of his mother, who embraced him as she wept with
love and gratitude.  As she held him, Bennie repeated over and over, “Sam,
Sam, Sam.”  Overwhelmed with emotion, the parents didn’t register this,
but someone else did.  The former Sheriff Durrant, now too old to be a
regular lawman, but always a volunteer, stood up straight, and a look of wonder
crossed his face.  “Sam,” he said softly to himself, and he walked back a
few yards so that he could see across the field.  Just as he did, he saw
the light go on in Sam’s bedroom window.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The
sheriff walked back to where he could watch as Doctor Jones looked at the
boy.  After just a minute the doctor said:  “He looks fine, other
than his curly hair is mostly gone.  But why don’t you drive down to the
hospital, and I’ll come down and we’ll have a good look.  Then we’ll find
a good place for you to stay until the house can be rebuilt.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The
sheriff tapped the doctor on the shoulder and said, “You rode out on the fire
truck.  Why don’t you let me give you a lift down to the hospital.” 
As the old sheriff and the doctor pulled out of the Gentry lane, the sheriff
said, “Let’s just stop in and wish old Sam a Merry Christmas.  It will
only take a minute.”  The doctor replied, “He’d be sleeping, wouldn’t
he?”  “No, I don’t think so,” the sheriff replied.  “I think he stays
too busy to sleep much.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">As
they pulled down Sam’s lane the sheriff said softly, “No track in or out.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“What’s
that?” asked the doctor.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“Oh,
nothing.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The
deep new snow on the doorstep was undisturbed.  The two men knocked, but
there was no response.  The door was not locked.  The sheriff pushed
it open and entered.  The doctor said, “Let’s go, he’s asleep.  
Let’s not wake him.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“Sam,”
shouted the sheriff, as he moved further into the house.  “Let’s look back
here,” he said, as he walked toward the bedroom.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">A
few seconds later they switched on the light and found Sam lying fully dressed
on his bed.  He didn’t stir as the sheriff said, “Sam! Sam! are you
okay?”  At the same time, the doctor took Sam’s limp wrist in his
hand.  There was a faint pulse.  He put his hand on Sam’s forehead. 
“He looks flushed,” he said softly.  “Feels like he has the flu that’s all
over town.  </span><span lang="ES-GT" style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%;">He’s burning up with fever.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The
sheriff moved closer and said, “I can smell smoke, can’t you, Doc?”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“Yeah,
it must be on our clothes,” replied the doctor.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The
sheriff spoke again, “Sam, can you hear me?”  There was no response. 
“Sam, have you been over to the Gentry’s?”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“What
are you talking about, Sheriff?” the doctor asked.  “This man is one of my
patients.  </span><span lang="ES-GT" style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%;">He can hardly walk.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The
sheriff leaned down so his face was only a foot away from his old friend and
asked, “Sam, did you go to the Gentry’s?”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“What’s
wrong with you, Sheriff?  I told you he can’t walk much, and he’s sick,
and besides, when we drove in here I noticed that there wasn’t a single track
out there in the snow.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">An
almost indistinguishable smile crossed Sam’s face.  A smile only someone
like the old sheriff could have seen.  Then his head fell to the
side.  Sam Edwards had died.  The doctor placed his fingers around
Sam’s wrist, and after a few seconds he said: “He’s gone.  The flu didn’t
do it on its own.  My best guess is his old ticker just plain gave out on
him.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“Maybe
too much strain?” the sheriff asked.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“No,
just too much age,” the doctor replied.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Near
two in the morning, the sheriff had the Gentry’s settled in at the local
motel.  Warren Anderson from the mortuary had come an hour earlier and had
taken Sam’s body away.  Now the sheriff came back to Sam’s house. 
There was something he felt he had to know.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Sheriff
Durrant parked his car just in front of the dark and quiet house.  In his
heart he felt certain that in some miraculous way Sam had gone to the burning
house.  Soon he would know.  Were there tracks out back and across
the field?  Had Sam saved the boy and brought the greatest joy a family
could ever know?<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">As
the old sheriff’s boots crunched into the cold snow, he felt for a moment he
could hear the angles singing.  He paused and looked up at the stars.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">He
spoke softly as he looked up.  “Oh, heck, Sam!  You and I both know
there ain’t no tracks out there.  Besides, I need to be home.  It’s
Christmas.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">As
the sheriff opened his car door, he looked back at Sam’s house.  He’d miss
his old friend.  A tear ran down his cheek, and he felt he heard Sam’s
voice saying, “I finally did it, Sheriff.  Merry Christmas.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="background: #FEFEFE; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">
<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Already
there was a rumor in town that the life of a little child had been saved by a
miracle.  </span><span lang="ES-GT" style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Sheriff Durrant felt satisfied with that.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<br/>This week has been pretty crazy traveling and all. Senahu was awesome, and Peten was sweet too! Yesterday we had our p-day and we went to TIKAL!!! It was super awesome! The thing is that we didn't have time to write today, so I have permission to write a bit today. We don't have a lot of time, so I will have to go into detail for this week and everything next week! So I will fill you all in on the details next week! Well no more time, but I am stoked for Christmas! I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas Day! Enjoy the snow! Have fun, and most importantly, remember why we celebrate Christmas! I love you all! Have a great week!<br/><br/><div>

Greetings from the mountain town of Sehanu!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Well its been quite a week and quite a day! To sum everything up, I've gone on two 'trips', we've had a ton to do in the office, and we've taught some great lessons!</div>
<div>
<br/>
I'll start with whats been going on today to start, because its the root of the craziness. Today all of us in the office, the APs the Secretaries and us, went to Senahu with President. As a mission we are having Christmas parties disguised as MultiZone meetings. There are three MultiZone meetings, one in Peten, one in Polochic, and one in Coban. Normally us and the other office people don't go to these multizones but the other day presidente decided that I needed to present the logo to everyone in the mission. So we are going to all the multizone meetings so I can show the logo to everyone... So today we have been traveling here to Senahu, which is in the heart of the mountains, and where people speak Q'eqchi'! So thats been fun! But me and my comp have to interview all the missionaries in English about finances, so thats a bit of a drag... So yeah its been fun to travel and the mountains here are AMAZING! I love mountains! They still aren't Utah mountains, but still they're mountains! Another thing is that this keyboard that I'm using sucks a ton. Half way through writing I figured out that the keyboard next to me works just fine, but too late... What ever. haha So we are going to be here in Senahu until tomorrow. Then monday we go to Peten. Another thing that Presidente suprised us with is that while we are in Peten we get to go to Tikal!!! Be ready for some sweet Tikal pics next week! haha </div>
<div>
<br/>
So these last two weeks or so we've had a ton to do in the office with all the Chritsmas stuff and all. We picked up the Christmas cards the other day and they look great!!! We haven't been able to teach a lot, but the lessons we've had have been great! Like as for me in those lessons I was able to take a bigger part even leading the lesson, and my Spanish was flowing and it all worked out. It felt really good and I am super grateful for the gift of tounges that I've been blessed with!!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well I don't really have much else to say. This week has been crazy and this keyboard makes it hard to type.,.. haha So yeah good things are happening, I am super stoked for Christmas, and alls well here :) I hope you all  enjoy the snow and the cold weather! I love and miss you all! Have a merry little week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>
Elder Kelley<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
p.s. Sorry no pics this week... I took a TON but I forgot my camera cord... meh. But next week I will send a whole email load of them!! </div>

Hola familia!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Voy a tratar algo que hizo Elder Blake. Voy a escribir esta carta en español para que puedo mejorar mi habilidad a escribir en español. Sé que haré errores y todo, pero no me importa. Y también estoy traduciendo mis español a ingles después de cada párrafo. Entonces el ingles hará simple...</div>

<i>I am going to try something that Elder Blake did. I'm going to write this letter in Spanish so that I can improve my ability to write in Spanish. I know that I will make mistakes, but I don't care. Also I'm translating my Spanish to English after each paragraph. So the English will be simple...</i></div>
<div>
<br/>
Pues esta semana terminamos el cambio. Nadie en la oficina tuvo cambios, entonces todavía estoy con Elder Vargas. Los nuevos misioneros entraron el martes, y también los viejos misioneros terminaron. </div>
<div>
<i><br/></i>
<i>Well this week we finished the change. Nobody in the office had a change, so I'm still with Elder Vargas. The new missionaries came in on Tuesday, and the old missionaries left.</i></div>
<div>
<br/>
El miércoles yo y Elder Vargas comimos almuerzo con uno de los consejeros de Presidente Faúndez, Presidente Poóu. Comimos un animal que se llama Tepezcuintle. Basicamente lo es un combinacion de un cerdo y una rata... Pero fue muy rico! También pude tocar su marimba! Una marimba es como un xylophone, pero mas como un piano.</div>
<div>
<i><br/></i>
<i>Wednesday Elder Vargas and I ate lunch with one of Presidente Faúndez's counselors, Presidente Poóu. We ate an animal thats called Tepezcuintle (I don't know what it is in English). Basically its is a combination of a pig and a rat... But it was really good! Plus I got to play their marimba! A marimba is like a xylophone, but more like a piano.</i></div>
<div>
<br/>
Recuerden que vivo con los otros Elderes que trabajan en la oficina. Pues uno de ellos, Elder Escalona, y yo hemos sido levandandonos temprano casi cada día esta semana para hacer ejercicio. Solo vamos al primer piso de nuestra casa para hacerlo. Usualmente solo hacemos como, push-ups, sit-ups, y cosas como así. Pero también saltamos cuerdo. Sé que es algo un poco extraño, pero esto es buen ejercicio! jaja</div>
<div>
<i><br/></i>
<i>Remember that I live with the other office Elders. Well one of them, Elder Escalona, and I have been waking up early almost every day this week to excercise. We just go downstairs in our house to do it. Usually we just do push-ups, sit-ups, and things like that. But also we jump rope. I know that is a bit strange, but it is good excercise! haha</i></div>
<div>
<br/>
Ayer estábamos en punto a entrar nuestra cita de cena cuando se fue la luz. Estábamos in la calle cerca a la casa. Fuimos a la casa y comimos la cena con la luz de una candela. Fue chilero! Y también hablamos y aprendimos algo de Q'eqchi' con la familia! </div>
<div>
<i>Yesterday we were at the point to enter our dinner appointment when the power went out. We were in the street close to the house. We went to the house and ate dinner with candle light. It was cool! And also we talked and learned some Q'eqchi' with the family!</i></div>
<div>
<br/>
Well that's all the Spanish I have for you all this week... haha This week Presidente finally approved the logo! It actually looks pretty sweet! I am gonna attatch it... We ordered the Christmas cards for the mission on Monday. I am super excited for them! I can't wait to show you all too! haha Presidente also has asked me to start designing a whole bunch of other stuff, so thats cool! </div>
<div>
<br/>
Well this week I read a talk called "He Hath Filled the Hungry with Good Things." It is from my very first General Conference!!! haha It is from the October 1997 conference, and it is by Elder Holland. This is some of the stuff I liked from it, "To those who may feel they have somehow forfeited their place at the table of the Lord, we say again with the Prophet Joseph Smith that God has “a forgiving disposition,” that Christ is “merciful and gracious, slow to anger, [is] long-suffering and full of goodness.” I have always loved that when Matthew records Jesus’ great injunction, “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect,” Luke adds the Savior’s additional commentary: “Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful”—as if to suggest that mercy is at least a beginning synonym for the perfection God has and for which all of us must strive. Mercy, with its sister virtue forgiveness, is at the very heart of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and the eternal plan of salvation. Everything in the gospel teaches us that we can change if we need to, that we can be helped if we truly want it, that we can be made whole, whatever the problems of the past." I just super love that, especially the underlined part! We can always change for the good! Another part I liked, "President George Q. Cannon said once: “No matter how serious the trial, how deep the distress, how great the affliction, [God] will never desert us. He never has, and He never will. He cannot do it. It is [against] His character [to do so]. He is an unchangeable being. … He will stand by us. We may pass through the fiery furnace; we may pass through deep waters; but we shall not be consumed nor overwhelmed. We shall emerge from all these trials and difficulties the better and the purer for them, if we only trust in our God and keep His commandments.”" I don't know if I've shared that before, but dang thats awesome! It is so true! Our loving Heavenly Father will never desert us. He never has, He never will. We will never be overtaken by any trials. We only become stronger from our problems and trials. When we know this, if we are having hard times we know that someday it will be better (Ether 12:4). I testify of this. I have grown and been strengthened here on the mission because of the hard times and trials. </div>
<div>
<br/>
Well thats all I got for this week! I hope you are all enjoying the most wonderful time of the year! Enjoy the cold! Enjoy the snow! While you are enjoying that, I'll be enjoying the heat and the green! haha I love you all! Have a fantastically awesome week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

</div><h1>¡Bienvenidos Diciembre!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-204979400922581003" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello family and friends alike!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
December is here! I woke up this morning and found a nice little present on my desk! I found a little rat poop! Yay! Happy December! We didn't know we had a rat problem until now, so we'll buy some traps and stuff... Don't worry about us. haha </div>
<div>
Well other than that it has been a pretty good December so far! We've been working on decorating the office with Christmas stuff!!! It hasn't been snowing, but it has been raining! I guess thats the closest thing I'm gonna get to snow here, so I'll live with it... haha </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Well this week has been pretty good. Unfortunately we haven't had much time in our area this week. Like two days we only had time in the area to teach one or two lessons... But its better than nothing! And this week I haven't done much fincance stuff. I have worked this week a ton on design stuff. I am getting close to getting the logo finished. Presidente Faundez keeps making me change stuff (for the worse), so its been taking a little longer... I finished the cover for the Christmas card, and it looks great! I started, and finished working on a project. There is a Christmas tradition here in our mission that every missionary gets a Face Book. It is literally a book of the faces of every missionary in the mission organized of when they leave. Its is to see when people leave, and to see your new comp when you have changes. It was gonna be done by the other office elders, but they were complaining about doing it. So I asked if I could do it. So I did, and my method was way faster, and I designed it to look super good too. So I'm having fun designing stuff here in the office! haha This week I've been getting over my cold too. Right now I am a ton better, but I still have a gnarly cough and my nose still runs like the Mississippi... I talked to the nurse and she is gonna get me some meds, so hopefully I'll be completely better by next week! So that was basically the week...</div>
<div>
<br/>
A few other things to mention: Today is the last P-Day of the change! I can't believe it! I've already had a change here in the office! I'm pretty sure that me and my comp are staying here, so don't worry ;) Mom asked me what the funniest thing was this week. The other day we were with the other office guys eating dinner with members. The family had a puppy. We were talking about it, and the other Elders thought that poopy was puppy. So they were saying poopy until we corrected them. It was way funnier than I just described, but its been an inside joke ever since. We'll ask each other if they want to pet our poopy. I don't know. It was way funnier in person... haha I hope you find some humor in the whole spanish/english mix up that we had... </div>
<div>
<br/>
Well on a more Spiritual note, I read some cool stuff this week. First of all, Manda shared a cool quote with me last Thursday on Thanksgiving. The quote said,"It is not happy people who are thankful. It is thankful people who are happy." I can't agree with that more. When we focus on gratitude we can realize all the blessings we have received from our Heavenly Father. And when we think like that we are happy, because we focus on what we have, not on what we don't have. <br/>
I have been thinking about some of the words of President Monson this week. I think I've already shared this quote before, but its a great one! He said, "Remember who you are and what God expects you to become. You are a child of promise. You are a man of might. You are a son of God." Wow. Powerful. I can't say anything else. Just read that, and think about it. And the talk this quote comes from is I think the most powerful talk I've ever heard. It is called A Sacred Trust from April 2016. Another super cool quote was from President Monson's Sunday Morning talk from this past conference. He said, "I testify of the great gift which is our Father’s plan for us. It is the one perfect path to peace and happiness." I love this too! I truely believe that when we follow our Heavenly Father's plan that we can be happy in this life and the life to come. Thats all I really have to share this week.</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well its been great as always to hear from you all today! I wish you all a fabulous December 1st. I hope you all enjoy this Christmas season! Have a super fantastic week! Enjoy the snow!</div>
<div>
Love ya!<br/>
Elder Kelley<br/>
<br/>
p.s. Watch the Church's Christmas video. Its super mega awesome! </div>

</div><h1>¡Bienvenidos a todos que lean esta carta!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-5174770462497914966" itemprop="description articleBody">
This week was a great one! A lot happened so I'll get right into it :)<br/><div>
<br/>First off, I'll talk about Cecilia's baptism!!! Everything went well for the baptism. There were a few hiccups, but they didn't matter in the end. One of them was that the font took way longer to fill than we thought. We were told it would take 6 hours (6 freakin hours!) to fill, and we started filling it on time. But when we checked right before, we still were missing a ton of water, so we had to wait a little longer to start the baptism. The other thing was that the 2nd Couselor checked the font about an hour before the baptism, and closed the church with his keys still inside... So we were all waiting outside the church for about 20 minutes before he found his spare keys. haha But obviously none of that matters. Cecilia was baptised, and afterwards you could tell how happy she was! I know that I was happy. The whole time I was smiling! haha And she asked Elder Vargas and me to talk about Baptism and the Holy Ghost, respectively. I just shared two scriptures and talked about the gift of the Holy Ghost. It was cool. :)</div>
<div>
<br/>The next thing that happened wasn't cool, but is actually kinda stupid funny. As a zone, we fasted from Saturday after lunch, so Sunday at lunch. So we fasted and everything. Every Saturday night we play soccer with the young men, and we always try to invite investigators and everything. We went because there were some investigators there. So I played and everything. Afterwards I drank a bit of water, then went to bed. Sunday morning I woke up and I was super tired, and I felt pretty weak. I just thought it was because we were fasting. We went to church, and over the 3 hours of church I went downhill. I couldn't stay awake, and after the second hour I could hardly even stand up, let alone walk. During the third hour, I starting having cold sweats and all that. I basically felt like I was dying. I know I'm probably exaggerating, but it sucked. I went with Elder Pin to the house, while the other guys stayed for Ward Council. I texted the nurse and she told me that I was basically super dehydrated... I drake water, ate some food, and took a nap, all recommended by the nurse. And after my nap, I felt a ton better! haha So yeah, it sucked when it was happening, but now it is kinda funny, but I know that I'll take better care of myself for now on! I've actually taken a lot more water this week than I have before! #StayHydrated</div>
<div>
<br/>Another thing that happened this week is that we started going to the gym every morning... I wasn't super thrilled about it, but Elder Pin is trying to motivate us to go. They all want to go to lose weight, and I'm just sittin here like, if I lose any weight I'll die!!! So basically I have decided to try to build up some muscle weight... So thats happening now, and I think we will stick with it for a while... </div>
<div>
<br/>Just a few other odds and ends: the other night when we got to the house Elder Vargas went into our bathroom, and our mirror had fallen off the wall and shattered everywhere in the bathroom... I got a cool pic out of it, so that was fun. Last Thursday we were in the mercado looking for a backpack, and I ended up buying the coolest sweater I think I've ever seen! I will send a pic of it or something. Its awesome!</div>
<div>
<br/>Well along the lines of Spiritual things, I have the awesome quote I wanted to share last week! Here it is, "We can say we believe in Christ as we believe in the sun at noon day, not that we can see it, but that by it, we can see everything else." - C.S. Lewis I think that is so awesome! And so true as well. It really is through Christ that we have perspective on life. It really is that by Him we can see everything. When we always have Him in mind, we can go through any of life's challenges with knowledge and faith. Awesome! Yesterday there was a worldwide missionary broadcast. Luckily I found a way to watch it in English, and it was great! Plus they made a few changes to the missionary daily schedule and key indicators. Nothing big changed, but it just helps us use our time most efficiently! </div>
<div>
<br/>Well thats all I really got this week! I hope you are all doing well, and I love you all so much. I wish you all a wonderful week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>Got up, got outta bed, dragged a comb across my head</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-1693999792857644241" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello one and all!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
This week has been a pretty crazy one! First of all, I don't have a ton of time, because I wrote a letter to all my missionary friends last week, and this week I had to reply to them all! haha I will try to get everything explained real fast. Basically the main things that have happened is Cecilia and changes, so I'll start with those.</div>
<div>
<br/>
This past week we have met with Cecilia a bunch of times. Last saturday we invited Presidente Faúndez to come to one of our lessons, because Cecilia had one of those super crazy hard questions that we didn't want to get wrong, nor did we know the answer to... Anyways, he came, and we had one of the coolest lessons ever! Presidente talked basically the whole time, and answered her question perfectly! The Spirit was most definitely there, and I know He confirmed to her the truth of that we were saying. Last tuesday we had her baptismal interview, and she is gonna get baptised this saturday!!! I am so excited! I know that she has been prepared, and that we have done everything we need to to help her enter the waters of baptism! For example, she was a reference, or referral or whatever its called in english, from a member, and we have taught every single lesson to her with a member present! We even had a FHE with her in a member's home! I know that the members play a key role in missionary work! Plus yesterday we had a lesson with her about the Law of Chastity, and Tithing, and she literally knew everything about it. We just asked her what she understood from them before we even started, and she knew. I know this is her time! I know she's been prepared! </div>
<div>
<br/>
The second big thing that happened was changes. Friday night we found out that out of the 6 people in the office, only two of us were having changes. One of the APs left, and Elder París left. So me and my comp stay together! I wasn't super thrilled, but I'll get into that later... This change we had to move the change day from tuesday to monday because some people were gonna have some crazy protest or something. We received the new missionaries, and said bye to the missionaries going home. In total, 14 missionaries came in and 12 left. So it was kinda crazy! But we got everything done, and it all went well! Change days are always crazy in the office.</div>
<div>
<br/>
So now I'll get into why I wasn't happy when my comp didn't have changes. A little preface is that normally missionaries stay in the office for 4 changes. They get trained for 2, and then train for 2. But my comp already had 4 changes and is on his 5th change right now. Basically it implies that I will also be here in total of 5 changes... I really don't want to be here longer than 4 changes. Plus for the first time in all my office days, this last week I really felt like I could take over and run the finances of the mission. So thats where the learning experience comes in. For my whole mission, up until this point, I kinda had an idea of what I wanted my mission to be like. I had it when I started too. Like I wanted certain stuff to happen. Then when I got called into the office, I changed my plan to make it fit my desires... But then it seems like I'll be here even longer, and it got to the point where I was mad that I will most likely be here longer. But then I was reading something that night, and it hit me. My mission isn't really my mission. I am here as a servant of Heavenly Father. Where I go, where I serve, how my mission turns out is all up to Him. He already has a perfect plan for me and everyone, so of course He already has a perfect plan for my mission. I just was too blind and prideful to see it. Now I know that wherever I go, will be where the Lord needs me. If my mission doesn't go according to my plan, I know it will go according to His plan.</div>
<div>
<br/>
So that talk that I was reading when I had that thought is super great! I found an awesome quote from it, but forgot to write it down, so it will have to wait till next week. But as I've been reading it, I've been thinking a lot about forgeting about myself and doing the will of the Lord. That is something that I've been working on lately, and I will like any help about the topic. So in the mean time, I am gonna study about it, pray about it, and do my best to forget myself and to the will of the Lord. </div>
<div>
<br/>
Well thats all I've got for this week! I know that in about 20 minutes or so I'll remember something I forgot to mention. But anyways, I hope you are all doing well! Have fun and be happy! Do whats right and look for the good! Have an incredible week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

Hi people!<br/><br/><div>
This week has been pretty great! Lots of stuff has happened here in the office as well as in the area! First off I'll mention a few little tidbits of stuff. I forgot to mention, but on Sunday the 1st, I gave a talk in Sacrament Meeting. It was the first talk I'd ever given in Spanish, but as far as I'm concerned it was great! I talked about how to be more reverent in our meetings, and I used Elder Meurs' October conference talk as a base! They told me to talk for 10 mintues and I talked for 12, so I call that a success! And other thing, I was looking on Church News the other day and found out that LaVell Edwards died! Ah that is so sad! And no one told me! Oh well. haha But it was sad when I found out... This last week has been the coldest I've ever experienced on my mission! It was super cold in the mornings. I've been sleeping with two blankets, plus wearing a hoodie (with the hood on) and my adidas pants. I am warm during the night, but its just getting out of bed thats hard! haha Sunday was the coldest. The rain stared Saturday night and didn't stop until Monday morning, so Sunday it literally rained all day. So it was freezing, raining, and all of our plans fell through on Sunday. Plus we were fasting, so it was just a sucky kinda day... But the good thing about Sunday was what will come next (hey what a great transition!).</div>
<div>
<br/>This week in the area has been pretty great too! To start off I'll talk about our prime investigator, Cecilia. This week we met with her a bunch, each time with a member. On Tuesday we met with her and she told us about her Sunday. She went to church with a friend in another ward, but she told us that she was just really weighed down by all the confusion in her life. She told us that on Sunday she prayed with real intent, because she really wanted to know which direction to take in her life. And she told us she got her answer and wants to be baptised!!! When she told us that all I could do was smile! I felt the Spirit so strong, and it was just a great experience! And this ties to my experience on Sunday, because me and Elder Vargas were fasting, and it was the hardest day of my mission, but look what came from our fasting efforts! Anyways, then we met with her yesterday, Wednesday, and she told us she wants to be baptised the 21st of this month! We weren't thinking she'd want to be baptised so early! We still have a lot to teach her, so hopefully we can get everything done before that! haha But pray for her, and us as the missionaries, that we can all do what we need to for her to be baptised that day! On a little sadder side we met with Gaby again. She told us that she did what we told her. She read 1 Nephi 1 and prayed about it, and she told us that she doesn't think its true. It was hard, just because she is not willing to accept the possibility that the Book of Mormon is true. But again, it was hard because we told her that we were gonna stop visiting her. Dang. But we can't keep spending time with someone who won't believe in the Book of Mormon. But Cecilia is progressing well, so thats good :)</div>
<div>
<br/>Well just a few more things. This week I've also been working on the calendars for Presidente. With the help of Elder Escalona, we got them all printed out, and all made. It took SO LONG to make them all, but in the end they turned out well. And other thing is that this is the last p-day of the change! It is really likely that I'll get a new companion. So that means that I will be Financiero 1! I'm still not sure if I'm ready for that, but I think I could figure it out. So next week I'll let you know whats going on!</div>
<div>
<br/>Well its been another great week, and I hope this next week goes well too! I hope you all are doing well, and finding joy in your lives. Oh and Bro. MacPherson sent me this cool quote I want to share with you! It is from President Hinckley and this is it: “Go forward in life with a twinkle in your eye and a smile on your face, but with great purpose in your heart.” So cool! Its kinda like the one from President Hinckley that I shared last week! Basically it is 2 Nephi 31:20. One of my favorites. I love you all, and wish you all a super week!<br/></div>
<div>
Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley<br/><br/><br/>p.s. the subject line refers to my Spanish... haha not really , but kinda... lol</div>

Hey everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Can you believe it?? 2017 is already here!!! It was pretty crazy how everything went down, but I'll get to that later! Oh and something that I forgot to share last week was this: I am already one toothbrush in! Props to anyone in the family that remembers about that! haha<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
Well this week has been pretty great! Things in the office have been going well. I've been working on a calendar for Presidente lately, and its kinda been a pain, but whatever. Like I always say, design stuff is better than finance stuff! haha But it kinda stinks because I haven't learned everything that I need to because I've been having to do so much design stuff... oh well. Things in the area have been going great!! We have gone on divisions or at least had a member with us almost every day! Teaching with members is the way to go!! Especially when we go with recently returned missionaries! But this week we met with Cecilia more. She is great! She reads the Book of Mormon like none other! Plus she has a ton of questions. She is praying to know that the Book of Mormon is true, and she knows that if she gets yes for the answer, she is willing to change her life to follow its teachings! We have been working with her lately to understand a ton of stuff. We've met with her almost everyday this week! At the end of each lesson she asks if we can come back the next day! Pray for her please! She is super close to the biggest blessings of her life! So that part has been super great, but something that was really hard happened with our investigator Gaby. We met with here the other day, and in her own words she told us this, "I can't believe in the Book of Mormon." Ah, dang. That hurt. It stinks because she hasn't really even been reading it! I told her the example of trying to explain the taste of salt to sometone who hasn't tasted it. She understood the idea, and she accepted our invitation to pray, then read 1 Nephi 1, and then pray again. I know that if she actually does that, then she will receive and answer. Prayer before scripture study is essencial! Plus I know that the first chapter in the Book of Mormon is the first for a reason. It is about Lehi.. He prays, and an angel gives him a book. As he reads the book, he is filled with the Spirit. The story of every investigator around the world.<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
Well that has kinda been the mission life for me this week! And as far as New Years Eve went for me, it was super awesome!!! We always play futbol with the young men every Saturday night. So this Saturday we played. And actually before hand we played some basketball! It was so much fun to play basketball! It had been so long! But futbol was SUPER fun! I am finally getting the hang of it! haha The team that I was on, we all worked together really well and had a great time! Something I always try to do with those activities is to have fun no matter what. Its really easy to get carried away in the competition and its really easy to play way hard. But like I said, I always try to be happy and be a good teammate in every sport that I play here in the mission. Theres no reason to play futbol if I'm not gonna have fun! Anyways, after the futbol game someone brought a giant firework, and they lit it off! It was awesome! I went to bed early and everything, but right before midnight I woke up to the other Elders screaming and yelling in our room. It was funny. There is a little tiny balcony thing with our house, and my bed blocks the door to get on there, but I got out of bed to go to the bathroom, and when I got back the other Elders were on the balcony. I couldn't really go back to bed until they came back inside. So I went out with them and watched all the ginormous fireworks and everything. It didn't last very long, we went inside and went to sleep. #2017 haha It was fun, but crazy.<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
I've got just two quotes to share this week. I've mainly been reading the Book of Mormon in Spanish and Q'eqchi' all week, so I don't have much to share from that. But I was reading the article on President Hinckley in the Ensign, and I came across a really cool quote. He said, "You work with optimism, work with faith, and things happen." I love it! Happiness and faith is what makes things happen! And when I was reading an article the family sent me in the Christmas package this is what I found, "Find joy in the journey." I love that one a ton too! Kinda like what I was saying about futbol, there is no reason to do anything, unless you have a good time doing it! I sure am on a journey right now. And realistically speaking, my mission is way to short to spend unhappy. I need to find the good things, the happy things, in my mission to find joy.</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well thats all I got for this week! Well two more things. I've been enjoying hot chocolate and tim tams for breakfast almost everyday this week. And its crazy that Manda has already been home from her mission for a year! Okay, thats it. I wish you all a very happy week! I love you all!</div>
<div>
Love ya!<br/>
Elder Kelley<br/>
<br/>
p.s. One more thing :P This morning we went on a hike with a member to some super cool waterfalls! It was awesome! So thats where those pics from from... :)</div>

</div><h1>I drew a kanagroo this week. And an eagle. They're pretty cool.</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-6706879785900538381" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hey!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Another week in the books people. Time flies like crazy. Really just normal stuff happened this week. Office life, missionary life, all of the above. Its starting to warm here, and its kinda rough. haha I've been drawing a ton too in my free time. Its been pretty great. I drew a kanagroo for a guy in the ward, and I drew an eagle for Elder Escalona, but I haven't given it to him yet... So don't spoil the surprise! haha So yeah, normal happy stuffs. Elder Escalona and Elder Pin had a baptism on Saturday, and it was pretty cool. And thats how I'll start.</div>
<div>
<br/>
Like I said the baptism went well. The coolest part was when we were waiting for her to enter the font. I felt the Spirit so strong! It was really cool. I knew that she was doing the right thing. It was a super cool feeling, and it helps me to know what I'm doing there is the right thing too :)</div>
<div>
Among other spiritual things during the week, I read a cool talk by Elder Holland given in April 2015. Its called Where Justice, Love and Mercy Meet. I came across it when I watched a Mormon Message. The video is about, and the talk starts off with, a story of two brothers, aged 14 and 19, who get into a sticky situation. The older brother basically almost dies, but the younger brother saves his life. You all really just need to watch the video and read the talk. Its amazing. Plus the ages of the brothers happen to be the same ages that me and Trev are. All I could think of while watching the video was what it would be like if Trev and I were in the same situation, with him saving my life. It was really cool. But this is my favorite part of the story, with my favorite part of the favorite part in italic, “But then suddenly, like a lightning strike in a summer storm, two hands shot out from somewhere above the edge of the cliff, grabbing my wrists with a strength and determination that belied their size. My faithful little brother had not gone looking for any fictitious tree branch. Guessing exactly what I was planning to do, he had never moved an inch. He had simply waited—silently, almost breathlessly—knowing full well I would be foolish enough to try to make that jump. When I did, he grabbed me, held me, and refused to let me fall. Those strong brotherly arms saved my life that day as I dangled helplessly above what would surely have been certain death.” Powerful. </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Another part I like says this about the Atonement, "the most majestic manifestation of pure love ever to be demonstrated in the history of this world." Its true. The Atonement makes everything possible, and gives us all hope. Then this is what Elder Holland says, "Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, suffered, died, and rose from death in order that He could, like lightning in a summer storm, grasp us as we fall, hold us with His might, and through our obedience to His commandments, lift us to eternal life." Christ saves us from the Fall. Okay, now go and read the talk and watch the video! :D </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
And here is a scripture that goes with it: 1 Corinthians 15:22. Good stuff.</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well other than that I don't really have much else to share. Just that I'm doing well. Our investigators are doing well. The office life is going well. Overall, good things are happening. Oh, and this is the last p-day of the change. It is highly likely that I will have a new comp by next week! Well keep enjoying life. Have fun this week, y hagan algo chilero! Sean felices!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Les amo mucho!<br/>

<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
Well tomorrow is the anniversary of when I got my mission call! Pretty crazy! So much has happened since then! haha As for this week, not much happened... Just normal stuff. In the office, Presidente has had me designing some more stuff, including a product catalog for some District President somewhere. It is an odd job, but its lookin pretty good! I have been drawing a lot this week too! I've found that it helps me relax. So I drew a cool Moroni for Presidente's birthday! Well thats all that I can remember, so I'll get into what I learned this week.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
<br/></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
I'll start off with what I read from <i>Our Search for Happiness</i>. Elder Ballard says, "Weaknesses become strengths, challenges become opportunities, trials become truimphs, and adversity becomes an adventure in the service of the Lord." Good things happen when we are in the service of our Lord. Being a full time missionary I get to serve all day every day! I know what Elder Ballard said is true, because I've seen those things happen here on the mission. Cool stuff. </div>

<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
Now for the fire storm of scriptures: </div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
Proverbs 15:13<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> "<span style="color: black;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.00784314);">A merry</span><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.00784314);"> heart</span><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.00784314);"> maketh a </span>cheerful<span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.00784314);"> countenance: but by </span>sorrow<span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.00784314);"> of the heart the spirit is broken."

Himno numero 158 (243 in english) has some cool words that the english version doesn't have. It says in one part "Cristo poder nos dará en la defensa de la verdad" which is Christ will give us power in the defense fo the truth. That is pretty cool. I know that Christ is always helping me here! In another part it says "En la lucha cruel empuñemos, sin temor" Pretty cool too. It means that in the cruel fights we push, without fear. Referring to D&amp;C 6:33-37 again, in Christ there is no fear. He is always with us. I love studying with the hymn book!!!</span></span></div>

Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
I hope you've all had a wonderful week! As for me here in Cobán, things went well! Life as a missionary is pretty good! I was thinkin about it today, and as much as I miss home and the family and everything, I am just fine here. I can't really imagine going home right now! haha Anyways, like I said this week was a good one. We had another birthday here in the office, I ate a ton of food, I drew a super cool elephant, and I learned a lot!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Hermana Gomez the nurse had her birthday yesterday! It was really fun, and all had lunch with her at it was a good time. Then we ended up having dinner with President. I was so full that I literally thought I was gonna throw up... It wasn't fun, but the food was so good! haha I drew a super cool elephant for Hermana Gomez for her present. It is kinda like a henna design kinda deal. I think its one of the coolest things I've ever drawn. </div>
<div>
<br/>
This week I read a BYU speech given by Elder Larry R. Lawrence last March. It is called Choose Happiness. I learned a lot. I'm gonna hit a few quotes, and talk about them... This is paraphrasing President Hinckley: The more often a person says thank you the happier he will be. When I read this, I thought about how many times I say thank you a day. I figured out that, there was a ton more that I could be grateful for. This week I've tried to say thank you more, and I have. Its been helpful to think more about thanking others. Here is a quote used in the talk that came from President McKay, "Start out to make somebody happy and see how quickly your own soul is filled with happieness." I thought that was cool too. Its so true. When we try to be happy and share our happiness we are all happy! Like we all know, or like we all should know, happiness is contagious! And here is the last quote, straight from Elder Lawrence, "Jesus votes for us, Satan votes against us, and we cast the deciding vote. It is my prayer that each of us will use our agency to choose happiness." This is so true. We literally decide to be happy or to be sad. We need to choose happiness! It is our choice!! And this quote hit me super hard today. This morning we all had a meeting with President. He piled a bunch of jobs for us, and specifically me, to do today. I had to spend a big chunk of my p-day working on those things. I wasn't super happy about it. In fact, I was in a bad mood, like a really bad mood until a little after lunch, like at 2 or so. We were all with the APs in their car going somewhere, and that quote came to my head. I thought about it, and I realized that all morning I had been in a bad mood. For some reason I didn't really want to do anything about it, just stay in my bad mood. But then the quote hit me again. I decided then, in the car, to be happy. I changed the face I had on, and I forced myself to smile. And you know what, about 10 seconds later I felt better. We all started to laugh a bit, and know I am back to normal! I know that happiness is a choice. And just like Elder Lawrence, it is my prayer that we all, myself included, will choose happiness. Let us all choose Jesus' side, because He literally is the source of all happiness. </div>
<div>
<br/>
I love you all, and I hope you all have a very happy week! And happy Valentines Day too! haha</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>
Elder Kelley<br/>
<br/>
p.s. Here is another cool quote I stumbled upon during the week that helped me: You can count the number of seeds in an apple, but you can't count the number of apples in a single seed. Pretty great!</div>

</div><h1>Watch that first step, it's a doozie!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-6145664287456626539" itemprop="description articleBody">
Happy Ground Hog Day everyone!<br/><br/><div>
I hope someone appreciates my Ground Hog Day quote. haha Well its been another week. To be honest, not a ton happened. Just normal stuff really. But there are a few things that are shareable, so here we go.<br/></div>
<div>
First of all, on Saturday we spent basically the entire day moving missionaries. We had to move two companionships of sister missionaries out of their houses and move them both into a new house. It wasn't bad, just took all day... But it was really fun to spend that time with other missionaries and help them out.</div>
<div>
<br/>Also on Saturday I developed a pretty gnarly cough, and on Sunday morning I figured out I have another sinus infection... meh. I talked with the nurse and she confirmed that I have a sinus infection and she game me medicine to take. Lots of coughing and lots of tissues. But I am already starting to get a bit better, so thats great!</div>
<div>
<br/>During the week we had a lot of time to go contacting, and we atcually found quite a few people! Among the group we found Familia Ibarra. They are great! The parents are actually both members, and none of their four kids are baptised. We are trying to get the parents activated again, and we are working with the kids to baptise them! But heres the cool part. About 3 or so weeks ago we contacted their house, but only the daughters were home so they didn't let us in. Then this week we were on our way to our area and out of nowhere an image of their house popped into my head. I knew we needed to go there, and we did, and we found something we didn't even see coming! So anyways, that was cool.</div>
<div>
<br/>Well among other things, we are still going to the gym in the mornings. Its actually not that bad. Today is Elder Escalona's birthday, so we've been having fun. I'm still doing design projects for Presidente.</div>
<div>
<br/>Unfortunately there wasn't a ton of time to study this week... But I have been thinking a lot and listening to a lot a few hymns. First off, Hymn 112, Savior, Reedemer of my Soul is awesome! In the second verse there is this, "Then let my lips proclaim it still, And all my life reflect thy will." As a missionary I have to do these two things, proclaim His word, and follow His will. Cool! Then all of verse three is super cool too! In the third verse we basically ask for help changing our wills to align with His more. Even though those things might be hard, we still need to do them, and He is more than happy to help us! And in Hymn 335, Brightly Beams Our Fathers Mercy, there are some cool missionary stuffs too. In the first verse there is this, "But to us He gives the keeping Of the lights along the shore." Heavenly Father gives me the keeping of the lights. I am in charge of making sure the light shines. In the chorus it says, "Some poor fainting, struggling seaman You may rescue, you may save." There is someone out there struggling that I need to rescue, that I need to save. I need to share the light of the Gospel with them!</div>
<div>
<br/>Anyways thats what I have to share for the week! Just as always in about 2ish hours I will think of something I forgot to mention, but thats the way it goes sometimes... haha Well I hope you all have a fantastic week! I love and miss you all!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>BYU speeches, jammed pinky, and fried ice cream</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-5557801729647945840" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hi everyone!<div>
<br/>This has been kind of a slow week this week. Not a ton has happened to be honest. We've had a bunch of work to do here in the office, and stuff happened so we couldn't leave the office on time for a few days... But it happens. But obviously good things are happening too! So lets get into it!</div>
<div>
<br/>First just some stuff that happened in the week. This past Sunday, the 19th, was Stake Conference. Presidente and Hermana Faúndez both spoke, plus the temple president and his wife, Presidente and Hermana Norman. Then our Stake President spoke, Presidente Coy. I think this was the most edifying and interesting Stake Conference I've ever been too! First of all, I stayed awake the entire time! Two hours! haha And I understood everything too, so that was a bonus. I learned a lot from each speaker. It was great! I took a ton of notes, but left my notes at the house, so I don't have much to share from that. But it was great! Then afterwards we went and ate lunch with the Faúndez. Hermana Faúndez is a great cook! Obviously Mom and Grandma are better cooks :), but she is pretty great! So that was fun. Yesterday we had a bomb lesson with the Familia Ibarra. We went with them, and I really had no idea what to share. We started talking with them and asked them why they weren't coming to church. Then the mom opened up about some problems they've been having, and we were able to help her with that. Me and Elder Garcia both knew exactly what to say. I shared with her Ether 12:4,6. Those scriptures are super great for when we are going through hard times, like they are. Anyways, the Spirit was there and we all felt happier and better afterwards. It was great!</div>
<div>
<br/>I've been reading a lot of talks this week too. I've been reading the talks with our little study guide, and I've come across a few talks too. Those talks led me to scriptures and other talks too! Its been awesome! A lot of them have been BYU speeches. The first one I read is called The Loneliness of Leadership by President Hinckley. I bet a lot of you have heard or read that talk. I found it out of nowhere really, and it was really helpful. There are examples of loneliness given in the talk such as missionaries, Joseph Smith, and of course the Savior himself. But there are blessings for standing up for what we believe in. And I found a cool scripture in 2 Corinthians 4:8-10, here it is: "We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body." No matter what happens we should always be examples of Jesus Christ. We will never be left alone standing up for our beliefs. </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Another BYU speech I read was actually given last month. Its called On Failure and Finishing by Cassy Budd. This talk is super awesome! Once again, it was exactly what I needed to learn. It basically talks about how we need to humble ourselves and continue learning from our mistakes. The sections, for the lack of a better word, of the talk are: Play Through Your Mistakes, Show Up and Try, and Accept Help. So I feel like you can get the idea of it. Later it talks about how the Savior will always help us. He will forgive us according to our repentance and diligence. He is always there to lift us up. At the very end of the talk it says, "May you each find the strength to fail and, in the hands of your Savior, the power to finish." I thought that was pretty powerful. In that talk it mentions another talk that I went and read. Its called Broken Things to Mend by Elder Holland. There are two parts of the talk that I love. First, speaking of Christ, Elder Holland says, "When He says to the poor in spirit 'Come follow me,' He means He knows the way out and He knows the way up. He knows it because He has walked it. He knows the way because He is the way." Second, "If you are lonely, please know you can find comfort. If you are discouraged, please know you can find hope. If you are poor in spirit, please know you can be strengthened. If you feel you are broken, please know you can be mended." Reading these two things really help us to understand the nature of Christ. Trust him, because He knows the way. He knows what He is doing. He will always help us. There is nothing His Infinite Atonement doesn't help. He knows how we feel. He knows how to help. He will always help, if we humble ourselves and ask for help. I love learning and teaching about Jesus Christ!</div>
<div>
<br/>And speaking of the nature of Christ, this week I worked on a new drawing about Christ. I'll include it of course. But while drawing it I was able to focus on and think about the nature of Christ. His attributes, His names, the things He did and does. It is one of the coolest word drawings I think I've ever done! There are so many things to learn about Christ. I hope you all will at least read one of the talks I talked about!</div>
<div>
<br/>Well that's really all I have to share this week! Among other things, today has actually been pretty fun. I played basketball this morning. Just me and three other Elders with a little two-on-two action. It was super fun! Plus we played in our shirts and ties, to that was fun too :P Plus I jammed my pinky pretty bad! Its huge! haha Its pretty purple too, but its all part of the fun! haha And when we are done writing we are gonna make fried ice cream!!! I am so excited to try it out!

Hello all!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
This week has been another pretty darn good one! I always get to Thursday and forget everything I did during the week, so bear with me. We've done a lot of work here in the office as well as in the area. My computer freaked out the other day and I had to fix that problem. And I've had some cool study times. So thats what I'll talk about. :D<br/>
<br/>
So stuff in the office is normal. Just gettin' stuff done and helping Elder Garcia learn everything. As for in the area, we've been teaching some cool people lately. I can't remember if I mentioned this last week, but we got a reference from a member. The person's name is Lesbie. She is super great and is ready for the message! Plus she told us to visit her sister, so we did. Her name is Sucell. Both of them are great because they get what we teach them. We are helping them understand the importance of the gospel in their lives. Prayers will help! :) We are talking with other people and all that, so life is good.</div>
<div>
<br/>
As for the computer problems... haha Basically what happened is that the computer has a local account set up, an account on the computer itself. For some reason the computer found and associated my church email, and changed the local account to a microsoft cloud account with my email... I know that almost none of you will get that, but it was super dumb. It automatically changed that. And for some reason I couldn't switch the microsoft account to a local account. So I contacted some microsoft peeps and they helped me. In total I talked to 4 different technicians. They all took remote control of my computer and did their thing to find and fix the problem. We tried a whole bunch of stuff, we even tried resetting the freaking computer. And it didn't fix the problem. Then the last guy I talked to fixed the problem in a different way than the others, and it was super simple. Like I could have done it simple. I just had to laugh at my self a bit. But its all fixed and life is good :) hahaha </div>
<div>
<br/>
I think I already mentioned that as a mission we have a study plan. Every day we all study the same scriptures and talks. And its centered on Jesus Christ! This morning really stood out to me. I am working on a drawing right now about Christ. I drew 'Cristo' really cool and I am going to surround it with words about Christ. Like his titles, attributes, and major acts. This morning I read a super cool talk that defines the words 'Jesus' and 'Christ.' The talk was given in General Conference in April 1984 by Elder G. Homer Durham. Anyways I learned that "the word 'Jesus' has parallel meaning with Savior" and that "the word Jesus means simply, 'God is help.'" Cool! And Elder Durham used a quote from James E. Talmage that I'll paraphrase here. The word Christ comes from Greek, and its identical to the Hebrew equivalent Messiah. They both mean "the Anointed one." Later on in the talk (I think) Elder Durham says that really it should be said 'Jesus the Christ.' Its cool thinking of it like that because Christ's name said in that way means, more or less, Jesus-or Savior- the Anointed One. Cool stuff. So I found a bunch of scriptures about the subject too. I found a bunch of new stuff to put in my drawing! I think we can all benefit from reading that talk. I'll send the link. :)</div>
<div>
<br/>
So yeah. There it is. Thats all I really have to share for the week. I'm happy you're all doing well. I know that Jesus lives. I know he loves us. I am a representative of Him. I love you all so much! Have a superb week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

Another week gone by!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Life is really like a blur these days. We've been doin' stuff in the office, and finding people like crazy! I'm teaching my new comp everything I can about the little finance world here in Cobán! haha Thats basically been the week! Just livin' and lovin' life! <br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
I am really sad that I left my study notes in the house today. I've read a bunch of really great talks this week! At the beginning of this change Presidente and the APs gave us all a Study Guide for the change. Everyday there are scriptures and/or talks to read. And they all are about Jesus Christ!!! Its been super awesome studying about Christ every morning. I've learned a lot, and felt a lot. We had a Zone Conference last Friday, and it was epic! We learned so much and the Spirit was so strong! Then yesterday, we had a Zone Meeting (yes there is a difference) and we talked about the Atonement and how it can help us be more unified as companions and as a zone! It was great too! <br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
On the missionary work side of things, we've found a bunch of people! We really only have two solid investigators. One is Maria, she is the girlfriend of a member. We've taught her for a while, she's learning slowly... but that doesn't matter because she is learning! The other is actually a family, the family Ibarra. The parents are less-active members, but 3 out of the 4 kids are above age 8! We've been working with them too, but its a bit harder, because they won't come to church... And out of the people we've found, there are a couple solid people! So we've been trying to work hard and help them learn and progress. <br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
Anyways, life is good and I'm trying to be happy all the time! Its hard to be happy all the time, but thats what I want. Sorry the letter is a bit short today. The words just ain't comin. haha But I've been drawing in my free time, and studying like crazy! <br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
I love you all, and I'm happy that you are all lovin' life too! Keep it up! We're all here to be happy! Have one super mega cool awesome week!<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
Love ya all!<br/>

Hey all!<br/><br/><div>
Well this week has been a pretty crazy one! We explored into a mountainy part of our area, we found 17 new people, Elder Vargas left the office, I got a new comp, and I've bought or been given loads of ties! So yeah, pretty crazy! haha My new comp is Elder Garcia. He is from Mexico. He is 22 and has about 5ish month on the mission. If fact, he got to the mission field the same day I entered the office. So anyways, its been crazy trying to teach him stuff in the office and all that. I'm now senior comp, and I sure don't feel ready for it. But I know that if I put in my effort, I'll succeed with the help of the Lord.</div>
<div>
<br/>Basically other than that, not much happened. Its just been really crazy around here. I haven't really had any time to study, which stinks. I've been trying to adjust to my new comp and my new role as financiero number 1 and senior comp. And I've been kinda homesick too, which I think has happened because I've been a bit stressed. But I feel like that happens to almost everyone around 9 months in the mission, or at least a lot of the missionaries here.</div>
<div>
<br/>And about the ties... There is an Hermana in the stake that hand makes super awesome ties. I bought two from her. One is a SUPER awesome flower tie and the other is a cool two color tie! I sent a picture of the flower tie. Then I bought some more flower ties and some corbatas tipicas like ties with like the native fabric... Idk how to describe it in english... But they're awesome too! Then we've gotten some ties from pacas. The other day I found ties for 1 quet. Thats like 13 cents. I bought five. haha </div>
<div>
<br/>So the part of our area that we explored was pretty cool. We'd been there before but only once. Its like 45 minutes away by foot, and its basically the mountains. There are a lot of Q'eqchi' people there. It was pretty sweet! We climbed to the highest point we could get to and I took some sweet pics! <br/>Anyways, sorry there isn't a lot to share this week, because just a bunch of crazy stuff happened. I'm gonna try to study a lot more this week. We should have more time. We didn't have a lot of time because of changed and all that. </div>
<div>
<br/>So yeah. Life is good. I'm workin on being less stressed... haha I hope you all are happy and having fun with life. I love you all, and I miss you all a ton. I know that I need to be here right now. Jesus lives. He loves us. He is the source of all happiness.<br/></div>
<div>
Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>Look, stairs....</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-1445067019632878339" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hey everyone!<br/><br/><div>
Here I am, another week gone already! This week we've been workin' and studyin' como chuchos! I've done a lot, and we've been working a lot too. In the last three days, I think, we've climbed in total over 500 stairs. And we also had to go down them... Its been fun :) haha Plus Saturday was one of the first days in a LONG time that we didn't get into any lessons. We had the entire day planned, and every single lesson fell through. We still were able to teach two lessons to member families, but still. Plus that day we walked the most I think I've walked in one day on my mission. It was nuts. But it was actually a good day. It got to the point that it was funny that nobody was home! haha Good learning experience. We also found and talked to a guy that is from Los Angeles. He has been living here for a while, but I talked with him in English and it was fun. Then a different day we saw a car pass by with an Alabama liscense plate! haha They stopped ahead of where we were going and we stopped and talked to the guys in the car. It was a guy and his son. They guy is from Guatemala, but has lived in the states for 30 some odd years, and his son was born there. We talked with them in Spanish, but they both know English. It was fun too. It was cool talking with them! haha This week I think in total we've given 6 or 7 Priesthood Blessings. On Sunday we gave 5 blessings!!! It was crazy, but really cool. I gave one of them, in Spanish. But today there was a sister missionary, from Utah, that wanted a blessing in English, so I gave her one. It was my first blessing in English in a while, but it was cool. It felt different than the ones I've given in Spanish. Obviously I think that its because it was in English, but it was cool. I felt the Spirit and it was a type of feeling I hadn't felt in a while. Giving blessings is such a blessing to the giver too!</div>
<div>
<br/>This week we've been working hard to find people to teach, and also teach the people we have. We are working with Axel, an older man, who is the only non-member of his family. We are working with him and teaching him the blessings of eternal families! He knows the blessings of getting sealed as a family, so we are helping him progress to get baptised! We are also teaching a man named Alex (yeah I know, Axel and Alex... haha). He is the father of a soon-to-be missionary. We've had some good lessons with him too! He wanted to come to church this sunday but he couldn't because he got super sick! Ah! We are helping him too! Out of everyone, they are our main people. Any prayers for them will be greatly appreciated!</div>
<div>
<br/>We've been reading el Libro de Mormón like crazy too! I'm already in Mosiah! I already feel like my ability to read in Spanish is improving a lot! I always love the story of Enos. Every single time!!! haha Enos 1:4-8 is the best! If only we could have faith like Enos! Plus I've been reading a lot from the Gordon B. Hinckley manual. Chapter 3 is the best!!! I cannot tell you enough what I learned from that chapter! I strongly encourage all of you to read it! It talks about happiness! Its awesome! Plus I found a bunch of cool scriptures. Ones that talk about happiness are Proverbs 17:22 and Proverbs 29:18. A cool missionary one is Alma 37:47. And one about strength in Christ is Philippians 4:13. You should read all those too! They're awesome! So thats what I've been studying this week :)</div>
<div>
<br/>Throughout about 3 or so days, I have spent about 4 hours in total cleaning the bathroom, the shower specifically. I scrubbed the heck out of the walls and the floor of the shower. It felt really good getting it all done, and it looks a ton better! The bathroom is finally clean!!! haha And like I said last week, I've make some changes here and there to improve the house. I've also made some stuff to better organize my study things. Its been fun thinking of ways to improve things. haha </div>
<div>
<br/>Well I think thats about it! I hope you are all doing well. I hit my 10 month mark on Saturday! Crazy! haha The time flies out here! I'm happy, my comp is happy, and life is good. I love you all and wish you a successful week! Keep on keepin' on!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><h1>A very long week...</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-6544978199540380524" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
I hope you are all doing fabulous! haha Well I've got a lot to talk about and not a lot of time, so here we go!</div>
<div>
<br/>
First off, saying goodbye to members and friends in Barrio 2 was super sad. I am still pretty close to them, so its not too bad. But there were some goodbyes that were pretty hard. There was one kid that I've come to be really good friends with. He is almost 14, so he is basically the same age as Trev and Dan. We went and visited him and his family, and when I gave him a hug, he started to cry... Oh man, I almost lost it too! It was a hug that I needed, because it felt exactly like how I felt when I gave Trev and Dan their last hugs before I came here. Powerful. It shows me the love I have for the people here, and also the love that I have for my awesome little brothers!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Last Tuesday was officially my last day in the office!! I've been here with Elder Reyes since. I'll answer a few questions mom asked to help you all know whats going on here!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Where exactly is Cobán 3A? In the office I was in the area Cobán 2B, meaning I was in the Cobán 2nd Ward, being the second of two companionships there. And Cobán 2 is in the south part of Cobán. Cobán 3 is on the east side of Cobán... I hope that helps :P haha</div>
<div>
<br/>
What is your apartment like? My apartment is one huge room. Missionaries have lived in this house for más o menos 10 years, so you can imagine what its like... It is pretty dirty, especially the bathroom. But I've taken a few mornings to clean the bathroom in pieces... And now it is SO MUCH BETTER! If people would just take the time to clean once a week... And mom, I know what you are going to say about that last sentance! Thanks for teaching me how to clean! haha I still have a bit to clean, but taking it in pieces has helped me not get overwhelmed by the amount of cleaning... haha And only me and Elder Reyes live there.</div>
<div>
<br/>
Info about Elder Reyes: He is the best! He was the AP for my first three months in the office, so we've already worked together a lot. He is from the Dominican Republic. He has been out for 21 months! He only has two changes left!!! Its pretty likely that he will finish the mission here with me. </div>
<div>
<br/>
Do you eat with members or prepare your own food or buy it from restaurants/stores? We eat with members when they invite us. For the most part we cook every meal for ourselves. We prepare everything in the house. Elder Reyes is actually a really good cook! He is going to teach me some Dominican recipies! haha <br/>
<br/>
Is it rainy there right now? Its not rainy right now. Right now we are in the hot sunny season. Its getting super hot! Ugh I prefer the cold! haha The beginning of rainy season is June. Beginning of winter season is around the beginning of October. </div>
<div>
<br/>
Anyways, so thats gonna help you all understand a bit more about whats going on! haha My duties as a Zone Leader this week have been pretty minimal. All I've had to do is recieve weekly dats, or stats... But this week we have two district meetings and next week we have a leaders meeting and a zone meeting! We've been working hard this week, and its been kinda rough! haha I've walked so much this week! haha And every day this week I have almost fallen asleep in at least one lesson... Oops. I only remember fighting closing my eyes, and then the next thing I knew was I was opening them! haha But its getting better now. I'm getting used to the 'normal' missionary life! haha And its actually been really fulfilling cleaning the house, and making it 'my own.' There are some things that I've cleaned, and somethings that I've had to fix that have helped me feel better about the whole thing. Plus thinking and planning ways to improve the house has been pretty fun! haha </div>
<div>
<br/>
Well now to some other stuff. At the beginning of this change we got another study plan from Presidente and the APs! We are going to read the Book of Mormon in 40 days!!! The first day I read the chapters for the day in English. During the whole day I was thinking about whether or not I should read it in Spanish or English. I decided to change, and read it in Spanish instead. The next morning I prayed for help to understand everything. So I started over, and read the previous day's chapters and the chapters for the day. I understood everything!!! I still haven't read the Libro de Mormón completely, so thats what helped me change my mind. So I am going to read the Libro de Mormón en 40 días! I am able to understand more and more each day. I know that by doing this my ability to read and also speak Spanish will improve! I read Spanish kinda slow, so it won't be easy reading it all, and I won't always understand everything, but I know that with the help of the Spirit, and the Gift of Tongues I can do it! I am so excited to do this! I started reading in Spanish on Thursday and I'm already in 2 Nefi 8! If you aren't reading the Book of Mormon everyday, do it! Listen to President Monson's council that we should read and study it every day!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well there it is. Among other things, today I played soccer with other missionaries for the first time in 6 months. I bought a new backpack, because the side bag I was using was messing up my back. I am improving my cooking skills here, and I'm also developing my home improvement skills! haha I read a cool BYU Speech about the Arts and the Spirit. It inspiried me to start writing a poem about the restoration! haha I'm still workin on it, but I think its pretty good! haha Just like always I'll think of something I forgot to share tonight while getting ready for bed,., haha And today I forgot my camera cord, so no pics this week ;( But next week you'll get a lot! haha</div>
<div>
<br/>
I love you all! I hope yo all had a great Easter Sunday yesterday! We are so blessed to have the knowledge that Christ not only suffered and died for us, but he was resurrected for us too! I know that He lives! Have an exquisite week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

Hi family!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
I know you're all wondering why I'm writing on Monday, so I'll get right to it. I forgot to mention last Thursday that changes are this week. We got told if we had changes on Saturday, and we were told where we were going on Sunday. And since I'm writing today, I think you already know I had a change. So I'm leaving the office!!! To be honest I am super happy. I didn't want more time in the office. I've learned a lot in the office, and its been great, but it is my time to leave! :P But I'm staying here in Cobán. I am going to the area Cobán 3A. Elder Reyes is going to be my comp!!! Elder Reyes was the AP my first two changes in the office. He is super cool. And last of all, I've been called as a Zone Leader! Presidente calls people when they become leaders or trainers, and yesterday (Sunday) night he called us. He called Elder Escalona, then Elder Pin, then me. Elder Escalona also is going to be Zone Leader and Elder Pin is going to be a District Leader. When Presidente called me I was freakin' out a little, because I didn't think he was gonna call me. But then he told me I'm gonna be Zone Leader! It was crazy. So tomorrow I will officially make the transition over there. And for now my P-Days will be on Mondays!!! Back to normal! haha </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
So I won't write Thursday, but next Monday. :)<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
I love you all and hope you are all doing well. I hope you are all happy and healthy and loving life! As for me I'm doing well, and I sure hope I can get the hang of being a Zone Leader! haha Have a super awesome week!</div>
<div>
Love ya!<br/>

What a week!<br/><br/>Greetings everyone! Well another week down! General Conference was amazing!!! I was able to watch every session, and watch 4 out of 5 of the sessions in English! I watched the Saturday Morning session in Spanish, and it was hard, but I understood almost everything! Yay! haha But it was amazing! And I also caught that Raymond Cutler was called as an Area Seventy! I was freakin' out a little bit like, "Hey I know that guy! He was my sister's mission president! He is my cousin's husband's dad!" haha It was fun. But I'll get into the Conference feels a bit later.<br/><br/>First off, my week was kinda meh. Last week we found zero new investigators. Zero. We have a mission goal to find at least ten every week. We had a lot of work to do in the office, and I didn't manage my time very wisely, so we didn't get out to find new people a lot... I was feelin' a bit down for that, and I haven't really been getting a lot that great with my comp. But Conference was amazing, and I got a lot of questions answered from that, and I felt a bit better about things. But on Monday morning I asked Presidente Faúndez for a little interview. Talking to him literally changed how I felt, and how I was looking at things. I haven't felt such peace as I felt while talking with him, and after talking with him. I feel like one of the biggest blessings I've gotten here serving in the office, is that I've come to trust Presidente Faúndez. Then this experience was the cherry on top. We talked about a bunch of stuff, and he helped me think about new ways to look at things. Seriously, it was amazing. I know that Presidente Faúndez is the man called by God to preside over this mission at this time.<br/><br/>Okay, now on the Spiritual side. First I'll talk about some stuff I read this week. I read a BYU Speech given March 14, 2017 by Weatherford T. Clayton called Rock of Our Redeemer. He talks about Heleman 5:12, and how if we build our foundation on Christ, we cannot fall. Elder Clayton brings up a cool point that "In the new Testament, repentance comes from the word metanoeó, from the words metá and noeó, meaning 'to change one's mind or purpose.'" Cool huh? Repentance essentially is a change of heart. Cool. I also found a poem or two in some Conference talks. One is called The Touch of the Master's Hand by Myra Brooks Welch. It is super great and you should all look it up and read it. And another I read is called Washed Clean by Boyd K. Packer. Look it up and read it too! This one talks about lepers and how Jesus healed them. My favorite part is the last stanza:<br/><br/>If we could only understand<br/>All we have heard and seen,<br/>We'd know there is no greater gift<br/>Than those two words- "Washed clean!"<br/><br/>Wow. What a powerful way to say it. It is a beautiful way to think about the Atonement of Jesus Christ! I know that through our faith and repentance, our sins can be washed clean through His infinite and eternal sacrifice. And this week I read a talk Mom sent me two weeks ago called The Law of the Harvest. It was really cool! I learned a lot, and its so true, that whatever we reap in our lives, we sow! I like this statement, "Whatever you give to life will return to you-multiplied!" Cool! If I give good things in life I will get even more good things in my own life. <br/><br/>Okay, now for General Conference. I learned so much. I felt the Spirit. I got answers to my questions. What a great weekend! I really can't say right now which talk was my favorite because I loved all of them! haha But I have a collection of top talks! :D Elder Nelson and Elder Hales helped me understand how to be more Christlike. Elder Andersen helped me to know what I need to do be more patient and humble. Elder Holland and Elder Palmer helped me know what I need to do to have a stronger desire to do missionary work, and Elder Bednar helped me know what I need to do to be a better missionary! And I loved the ideas expressed in Elder Sabin's talk. Standing up on the inside is such a great thought! I really liked this talk, because Elder Sabin gave so many examples and made the concept really understandable and personal. And Elder Choi's talk was great too! The idea of always looking up is great too! I love what he said, that is the title of this letter. "Go our in the rain, look up to heaven, open your mouth, and drink it!" haha We are starting to get into rainy season here, so I'll think of that when it rains! haha And obviously President Monson's talks were amazing! His Priesthood session talk was super great. I really needed to hear his message about being more loving and kind. And his Sunday Morning session talk was great too! I really had been getting caught up in other studies that I hadn't been reading the Book of Mormon every single day! I know that is something we really should and need to do to stay strong! I felt the Spirit during Conference, but I felt the Spirit the strongest when I was listening to President Monson's talks. I felt the Spirit so strong! So strong, that at the beginning of his Sunday Morning talk, I couldn't help but smile! I know that President Thomas S. Monson is the Lords Prophet and leader of this church.<br/><br/>Well there ya go! That is what I've got this week. I feel like it kinda makes up for my little letter last week. I hope you all were able to have a good Conference Weekend. Reread your favorite talks. They will help you. I know this is the true church of Jesus Christ. I know that Jesus lives and that He loves us. I love you all, and hope the best for each and every one of you. Have a super fantastic week!<br/><br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

To family and friends alike: Hi!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
I was thinkin' earlier today about what I was gonna write, and really nothin' came to my head... This week has been pretty crazy, and I haven't really had time to study, nor proselyte. Its kinda sad, but thats the way it goes sometimes here in the office. </div>
<div>
<br/>
Well good news is that my pinky is super great! It is normal, just a little purple still. But bad news, I re-jammed it playing basketball today... But I played basketball today and it was super fun! :D </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Another lil bit of bad news, I got sick on Monday. I was just fine, then right before lunch, my stomach didn't want to be happy anymore. It was pretty rough... I am still a bit sick with the same problem, but its much better than it was Monday.</div>
<div>
<br/>
Today has been overall a pretty great day. We woke up a bit early and played basketball with the APs, six of us in total. We played a real game and everything. It was super fun!!! Then we played PIG afterwards and its was super fun! especially because I won :P Then for lunch we went to the Faúndez's house. We had a fun time and a really great lunch! Afterwards we had a piano jam sesh and I discovered my inner singer, so that was fun :D haha We went to Megapaca, which is a giant paca, giant thrift store. Anyways, I found a super dope old style Jazz shirt! It even has John Stockton's name and number on the back! haha And it cost me the equivalent of $3, so it was a sweet find :) So that has been more or less my day!</div>
<div>
<br/>
We had a few lessons this week, and one of the best ones we had was with an investigator named Sammy. We found her, her boyfriend (for lack of a better word), and her kids about 2ish weeks ago. We just taught her this time. We kinda recapped the first lesson, the Restoration. She was super open and explained to us her confusion why God wouldn't visit all his children on the Earth. She agreed with us that the Book of Mormon makes sense and everything because Jesus Christ came and visited the people here in the Americas. It was cool, because she was putting everything together herself! We are working with her and her boyfriend so they can read and come to church. Plus they have to get married before getting baptized... So pray for them so they can understand why they need to make those changes in their lives!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Really other than that I don't have anything else to share. Its been a normal week and everything. I've been working on a new simplified finance guide in Spanish. Its going pretty well. Things with my comp are fine. Its not all milk and honey, but I'm tryin'. I am still learning a lot from my studies about Christ. Next week I'll have more stuff to share about it! Well I love and miss you all! I hope you all have a fantastic week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

</div><h1>Another long week...but good!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-1752319957526495643" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hi!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
This week was even longer than last week! Ah it was rough. I thought it would never end, but it did! haha But I don't know why but these last two weeks have been really long. The time passed super slow. I think thats what happens at the 'almost year mark' so I think its kinda normal... I hope. haha But this week was a good week. I'll get into it.</div>
<div>
<br/>
I'm still not loving being in a trio, but thats what I have to adjust to now. Our new comp is just fine, but its weird doing everything in 3... 3's a crowd! haha I'm workin on it though. It actually makes contacting a lot more fun. I don't know why. But while contacting we all take turns knocking the door and we talk while walking. So thats a good lil thing :)</div>
<div>
<br/>
Today we had Concilio, the meeting with all the leaders of the mission. So thats why we were writing a bit later today... But the meeting went really well and I learned a lot. We learned about what we need to do to earn the trust of the Lord so He will bless us in the work. Plus I got so see a bunch of my pals like Elder Escalona!</div>
<div>
<br/>
This week I finished our study plan of the Book of Mormon! Overall I read it in 44 days! I read it in Spanish. Wow, what a cool experience! It was such a blessing to be able to focus so hard on the Book of Mormon and read it all so fast! Plus I am super happy for deciding to read it in Spanish. I have seen the blessings of reading it in Spanish. My reading ability is a lot better, and I am getting better and better speaking it! It was so cool! I prayed after I finished it, and felt the Spirit testify to my heart that its true. I know that the Book of Mormon is true. I know its the word of God. The Book of Mormon is such a blessing. I know it contains the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ. I am so happy that I get to testify of it everyday! I know that we can receive more blessings in our daily lives if we try to read it everyday! We need to follow the council of President Monson!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Sorry the letter is short this week. I didn't have much to write about... Oh now that I think of it I made a study plan to read all of Doctrine and Covenants in 40 days! And of course I'm going to do it in Spanish! haha Well I'm glad life is going well. I'm glad that everyone is happy! I love you all! I hope you all have a splendid week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>
Elder Kelley<br/>

</div><h1>11 months, ward split, changes, and an amazing lesson</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-8591560465586162946" itemprop="description articleBody">
Greetings one and all!<br/><br/><div>
What a week! Truth be told, it was one of the longer weeks I've had on the mission. It didn't help that on Thursday I thought it was Friday. I thought it was Friday all day long, then realized it was only Thursday in the night... haha But there were some pretty great things and changes that happened this week! And the changes will be taking place this week! So I'll get into it! </div>
<div>
<br/>First of all, today is my 11 month mark!! Crazy! I will hit my year mark in a month from how! Crazy!!!</div>
<div>
<br/>Second of all is the division of the ward!!! Yesterday was our Ward Conference, and the Stake President announced that our ward is splitting! Our ward was Cobán 3, but now we are Barrio (ward) San Marcos and Barrio El Periferico. We had 2 companionships in the ward, so each of us will take one ward. We are going to stay in Barrio San Marcos! But the thing is that before, we had most of the other side in our area. So me and Elder Reyes are basically having a change of area! We will lose a few investigators due to the change, but we will be able to keep a few of them.</div>
<div>
<br/>Third is that changes, or transfers, are happening again!!! Me and Elder Reyes are both staying here together!!! I was praying for that. I didn't want either of us to have a change! But the thing is that they are giving us another Elder, so we'll be in a trio. I'm still not super thrilled about the idea, but we'll see how it goes... Elder Lawrence is gonna come with us. But the even crazier thing is that Elder Reyes and Elder Lawrence both go home after this change!!! In mission jargon, I won't only be killing one Elder, but two in one change! Its gonna be crazy with them both preparing to leave. But I'm sure it will be fun :) haha</div>
<div>
<br/>Fourth is the best! Save the best for last right?? So last Tuesday me and Elder Reyes were walking and went to visit someone. They weren't home. Then we went to our Plan B, and they weren't home either. While we were walking to a place to contact our investigator Alex drove by on his motorcycle. He stopped and waved us down. We went and talked with him. He told us that he needed to talk to us, because he had a dream! We were in the perfect place at the perfect time to see him and talk with him. So on Thursday we went to his house and had a lesson with him. It was one of the best lessons I've ever had!!! He told us about his dream, and helped him understand it. We told him that he had the dream because God wants him to make some changes and take some steps in his life. We explained that this step was baptism. We invited him to be baptized and he said yes!!! We asked him to be baptized on a specific date, but he said that he still needs to think about when he want to do it. But the Spirit was so strong!! It was the first time in a long time that I felt guided by the Spirit during the lesson. It was truely amazing. It helps me understand how important the Spirit is in teaching, and that really I'm just an intstrument in God's hands! It was an amazing experience! </div>
<div>
<br/>Well thats about it! I don't really have anything else to share. But this week was really an amazing week. It was slow, but I saw the hand of the Lord in this His work. From the Spirit guiding a lesson, to a ward dividing, its really all because the Lord is hastening His work! And I am really blessed to be a part of it! I love you all and wish you a wonderful week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>Multizone Conference, Rain, and Skype</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-8770738576009772287" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello everyone!<br/><br/>Happy Mother's Day (one day late) to all you wonderful mothers out there! It was great talking to the family yesterday! But I'll get to that in a bit. Here are some of the biggest things that've happened this week!<br/><br/>So last Thursday was the Multizone Conference that I was talking about. So 3 zones got together and we had a good meeting. All of the Zone Leaders and Sister Training Leaders taught, but me and Elder Reyes were the only ones that didn't teach together. But I prepped my lesson, and it went really well! I was actually really excited to share it! But I was only able to share part of it because I ran out of time... I only shared the boring part! I kept the best part for last, but I wasn't able to share it... It was sad, but thats what happens sometimes. But I learned a lot in the conference! <br/><br/>Last Sunday a priest in our ward asked me if I could confer upon him the Melchizedek Priesthood and ordain him and Elder. So on Thursday we did that. We met in the house of the High Councilor of our ward, and I did the ordination. Truth be told, I didn't feel much while doing the prayer because I was thinking really hard about what to say in Spanish. But afterwards I felt really special. It was a cool feeling. It was an honor that Jorge asked me to ordain him. His dad couldn't do it, so thats why he asked me. But it was really cool, and it was a special experience. <br/><br/>We've officially entered rainy season! The last three days its been sunny and hot in the morning, and around 1 or 2 its clouded up and rained super hard for the rest of the day! I don't love walking around in the rain, but its a little better than walking around in the sun! haha But Saturday was hard because we had the entire day planned with already set visits, and no one we visited was home... And it was raining all day. We were in the rain almost literally all day! We were able to find 2 new people, and have a lesson with member, but it was still pretty rough. But its all part of the experience! <br/><br/>Calling you guys yesterday was amazing! The whole experience started off rough, but it all turned out. After church and ward council, we had lunch. Then we went to the member's house to do the call. We had talked with them beforehand and everything, but then we got to there house, they weren't there!!! We waited for about 15 minutes and called them a few times, but they didn't pick up... So we went back to the church. Our church is the Stake Center, and they have a room there that is the Family History Center for the Stake. Luckily people where there, so it was opened, and luckily they let us call from there. So it all turned out. But it was great seeing and talking to you guys! It was cool because it felt so normal talking with you. Its like nothing has changed! haha <br/><br/>Well thats all I really got this week! We are still chuggin along reading the Libro de Mormón. We start 3 Nefi tomorrow! We are almost done! Crazy! We are reading it so fast and it is so cool! I am understanding everything in Spanish! Obvisously there are words here and there I don't understand, but its coming along! I love it! I actually made a plan to read Doctrina y Convenios in 40 days next change! haha <br/><br/>I love you all and hope you are all doing well. I wish Kristen and Mark and their family good luck this week as Kristen is getting close to having her baby! I wish Mom good luck with Preschool Graduation this week as well! I hope you all have a splendid week!<br/><br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley<br/><br/>p.s. Proverbs 4:7 is a good one! One of the little nuggets I found this week! haha<br/><div>

</div><h1>I taught una lección in Spanglish this semana</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7362090317365690359" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Another great week! A lot has happened, but I don't really have much to say about it... haha I'll do my best!<br/>
<br/>
We did divisions this week with the Elders in Tanchi. Elder Hair sayed here in Cobán with me, and Elder Reyes went to Tanchi with Elder Alvarado. I think I mentioned that a few weeks ago that we met an American guy. While I was with Elder Hair, we met him again, and he invited us to his house! We had a lesson with him in Spanglish! haha We started out in English then slowly moved into Spanish because he hasn't spoken English in a few years... But it was super cool! And I think we can help him improve his life! He has a deep love for his family, and we are gonna try to help him come unto Christ talking about eternal families!!! And at the end of the lesson he gave us a giant plant because he wanted to... It was funny haha</div>
<div>
Another person we met this week is named Aura. She is an older lady; shes a grandma, so that will help give you an idea. But the is confined to a wheel chair because of a sickness she developed a few years back. She has been in the wheel chair for 6 years, and doesn't really leave the house. But this woman is one of the happiest people I think I've ever seen! I think I was smiling the whole time we were with her! I felt so happy being with her. We can all learn a lesson here. It doesn't matter what circumstances we are in, happiness can always be attained!!! </div>
<div>
<br/>
Among other things, there were two baptisms in the zone this week, and we were asked to go to both of them. The Spirit is always so strong in baptisms! We played frisbee this morning and it was fun. We have a Multi-Zone Conference on Thursday! I have 15 minutes to teach! Personally I have 15 minutes to teach over 55 missionaries! I've been workin on it for a while, and I worked a lot on it last night. I think its gonna turn out well. And I've been developing a pretty sweet spreadsheet to help my lesson! Dad, I know you'd be proud! haha The other day we had interviews with Presidente. He is going to start interviewing all the missionaries every change now! But anyways, in my interview with him, I sincerely felt like I was talking to a good friend. It was a cool and very good feeling. Its something I've never felt before while talking with him. I know that one of the blessings of serving in the office is that I was able to become closer to Presidente. It was cool!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well sorry its kinda short this week. I got nothin else. I am happy that you are all doing well! I hope you all have a wonderful week. I love and miss you all! </div>

Love ya!<br/>

</div><h1>I'm bakin' like a toasted cheese-it! It's so hot here!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-1611675596695275132" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello family and friends alike!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
This week has been the hottest I've experienced here on the mission! It was rough! Today is a little cooler so thats good :) But seriously, its not very fun to go contacting in the sun when its 90 degrees... But I wouldn't learn anything if it was easy! haha I've learned to walk more in the shade! haha<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
This week went well. We worked hard as always, and did our best to be our best. We've visited a lot of people. We had a great lesson with Axel and his family about going to church as a family. He told us he would go to church, but then he didn't come... It was sad. So thats what we need to work on with him. We had a lesson set up with Alex, but we had to put it later in the week, and then we had to change that one to next week... So we didn't meet with him this week. We found a couple of new people that are promising, so we will work with them this week to see how we can help them! <br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
As for duties as Zone Leader, we really just went to District Meetings. But in one of them we were asked to share something, and in the other one we were asked to give the lesson. It was the first time that I shared something with the missionaries in the zone as a Zone Leader. It was really cool, because something came to my mind to share. I started to share it, but it was kinda rough at first. But then something clicked and I was able to share exactly what I wanted to say! The same thing happened in the other District Meeting. I know that it was the Spirit working through me so say the things I needed to say to help the missionaries in my Zone! It was so cool! And this morning we had a Leaders Meeting. Its a meeting with all the Zone Leaders and Sister Training Leaders in the whole mission! It was really cool! I learned a lot. Plus I was able to see a lot of my friends in the mission, like Elder Toolson, and Elder Escalona!!! Good times :)</div>
<div>
<br/>
In our Book of Mormon reading we are in Alma already! We are reading a lot every single day and its great! I learned something really cool! Alma 5:7,12 are really cool! They talk about a change of heart. My favorite part of verse 5 says, "their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word" Cool! I like the contrast of light and darkness in this verse. And its true, our souls should always be iluminated by the light of the everlasting word! And verse 12 says that this change of heart comes from faith! Cool stuff.</div>
<div>
<br/>
Other than that, just other little stuffs happened during the week. I drew two cool drawings. I drew a quetzal and a turtle. I drew the quetzal for a shirt design I'm working on for the zone, and the turtle is for a missionary's birthday. So life is good, I'm happy, and working hard. I know that I have lots of room to improve, but I'm learning bit by bit. There is no other place I would rather be right now! I love missionary work, and I love sharing the gospel every day! I love you all, and hope you have a fantastic week! Live it up!</div>
<div>

Love ya!<br/>

</div><h1>In the Middle of an Adventure</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7171377930479955789" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello everyone!<br/><br/><div>
Get it? In the middle of an adventure? haha I crack myself up.<br/></div>
<div>
Well its official. I have been in Guatemala for more than a year. Its really weird to think about it, that a year ago right now I was in the MTC scared out of my new little pants! haha This week was a good week as usual. We're workin' hard and lovin' life!</div>
<div>
<br/>Well on Wednesday Elder Lawrence went home! So since then we've been runnin' again in a duo! Also on Wednesday night we went to visit Lorena's parents again. We got there, and they were home! We had a lesson with basically the entire family! We talked with them and the lesson went really well, and the Spirit was strong and everything! We asked the parents to give permission to Lorena to get baptized, but they didn't say yes or no... Well really they are both in favor of her getting baptized, but the dad wants Lorena to ask him directly for permission... The next day we went with Lorena and had a good lesson with her and explained to her the situation. So she knows that the next time she visits her family she needs to ask her dad for permission! So lets hope all goes well and that Lorena can get baptized!!!</div>
<div>
<br/>Thursday was my 'cumpleaño'!!! haha I completed one year on the mission! And to celebrate it I woke up to a baby earthquake!!! I literally woke up, and was sitting on my bed with my eyes closed (still kinda sleeping haha) and our house started shaking. We live on the second floor next to a big(ish) road. Every time a big truck or bus passes by it shakes the house. So I thought it was just a bus or something like that, but the house kept shaking. I looked around and everything was shaking, and then I looked over at Elder Reyes. He was still laying down, and I wasn't wearing my glasses so I couldn't tell if his eyes were open, so I just asked him if he felt it, and he said yes. It was the first time I have experienced, or at least noticed, an earthquake. It was nothing big, and it was only about 15 seconds long. I bet it has something to do with the earthquake that happened last week on the other side of Guatemala. So yeah, good times. Then we went to Tanchi for a district meeting and the meeting was great! Elder Reyes taught, and blew all of our little minds teaching us about the Plan of Salvation! Some of the missionaries bought a cake for my cumpleaño! It was great! Then we all ate lunch at a members house. We ate caldo and it was probably the best caldo I've ever had! It was great! haha </div>
<div>
<br/>Well that's all I really got... Among other things, Elder Reyes is teaching me how to cook some of the stuff he always makes. I've started by learning how to make rice his way! Its great! haha We also found a cool little ice cream place the other day, and they have super good ice cream! I've tried about 6 flavors in total, but the most mentionable ones were Avacado and Star Fruit! The Avacado ice cream was really weird, but it was the creamiest ice cream I think I've ever eaten! haha And the Star Fruit ice cream was amazing! It was really good, and it makes me think of Hawaii :) I also tried Passion Fruit, and it was super awesome too! And of course I tried Strawberry! And it was amazing too! I think it is the best Strawberry ice cream I've ever had! haha</div>
<div>
  <br/>I've been here for a year and I have a year left. I've been reflecting on my past year and the year that lies ahead. I have learned so much in this short amount of time. I have learned so much about the Gospel. I've learned Spanish, and little bit of Q'eqch'. I have had a lot of really fun and cool experiences. I have met so many people and made so many friends. I've had the opportunity to serve as a Finance Secretary and also as a Zone Leader. But I think that the most important thing I've learned here is that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ live. Sure I knew that before the mission, but not like I know it now. I know that thanks to Heavenly Father's perfect plan, I have a purpose in this life. Thanks to His plan I know that I will live with my family eternally. Thanks to His plan, Jesus atoned for my sins. I know that Jesus suffered for my sins. I know that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ I can become clean again, and that I can keep trying, keep improving. For the next year, the last year on my mission, I will take this testimony that I have and make it even stronger. I will share my testimony with even more people. I will improve even more. I hope that I can be an effective tool in the hands of the Lord this next year to bring even more of His children to the truth. <br/>I love you all and hope you are all doing well! I wish you all a superb week!</div>

<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>The Adventure Continues</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7145967299806272692" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hola familia y amigos!<br/><br/><div>
Another week done and gone! Time is flyin! As you all have calculated, this Thursday, the 22nd, will be my official one year mark in the mission! It is so weird! It seems like yesterday I started this grand adventure. I still can't believe that almost a year ago I entered the MTC. Crazy stuff! Well this week went well and I've got some cool stuff to talk about!</div>
<div>
<br/>To start I'd like to talk a bit about some of our investigators. I realized that I haven't said anything about them in a while. Our main investigator is Lorena. She is 16 and is so ready to be baptized! But the thing is that her parents didn't give her permission to be baptized... So that stinks a lot. And she doesn't live with them so its hard for her to talk to them because she only visits them a few times a month... We have another who is named Paulo, who was a reference, or referral in English... haha But we are helping him accept and understand the Book of Mormon. Other mentionable investigators are Fredy and Gladys. Fredy is an older man that doesn't believe in religions, so we are helping with that. Gladys was a reference too, and we are working with her and her family to accept the gospel as well! We have a lot of other people we are teaching as well, but they are our main peeps right now!</div>
<div>
<br/>Now that you know the situation about Lorena's parents, I can tell you of what we did to help. The other day in the morning we went to her parent's house! It is about 30 minutes away in bus. It is in this little aldea, village, that is pretty secluded. We had a fun time walking around in the rain trying to find the house, then walking out to the bus stop. The good thing is that we found the house! The bad thing is that her parents weren't home. But we were told of a better time to visit them, so we are going to go back this week and we are going to help them understand why Lorena should get baptized!</div>
<div>
<br/>Among other things there are a few cool scriptures I read this week in my Doctrine and Covenants study. D&amp;C 88:67 talks about what happens when we are filled with light, and D&amp;C 93:26-28 talks about the blessings of receiveing the Spirit of Truth. They are both really cool, and I hope you all take time to read and ponder over the teachings of these two scriptures! Other mentionable things this week are that I ate turkey blood. Yes, I ate it. We had lunch with our landlords on Sunday and they prepared turkey blood for an apetizer. It was actually really good! It was prepared with spices and chile and it was good! But I just couldn't get over the fact that it was blood... haha It was kinda the consistency of jell-o. haha Oh, and Elder Lawrence will go home this week for a job opportunity, so we will roll with a duo again for the last week and a half of the change! </div>
<div>
<br/>And now for the coolest thing that happened during the week. We had our Zone Conference and it went well. Elder Reyes and I taught out little lesson and it went well and all that. But what was the best was Presidente Faúndez' lesson. He talked about the Atonement for a bit and then we did an activity. This activity I had heard of before this, but it was the first time I had participated in it. Pte. asked the Elders to stand up. He asked us if any of us were willing to suffer pain for the rest of the missionaries in the room. He asked us to sit down if we weren't willing. He asked a few more questions and then he asked if any of us were willing to suffer pain until tears for the others. We all sat down after that. He asked for a volunteer that would do it. Elder Garcia, my ex-comp, volunteered. We gathered in a circle around him and Pte started around the circle asking every missionary if they wanted a few pieces of chocolate. As they said yes, Elder Garcia had to do 7 push-ups for every missionary to receive their chocolate. At first it was pretty easy for him to do the push-ups, but then he started struggling. It was powerful. We all stood in silence watching Elder Garcia doing push-ups when he literally couldn't do more. He kept doing it so we could have our chocolate. It was super spiritual. Towards the end, it was actually hard to watch him struggling so hard to finish the push-ups. Beforehand, Pte. had asked us what the Atonement ment to us. When Elder Garcia finished doing push-ups for everyone, Pte. asked us again. The feeling changed after the activity. The Spirit was stronger. What I felt was that the Atonement was the biggest act of love in history. But the most amazing part was what Elder Garcia said. Elder Garcia was standing next to Pte, his face red, covered in sweat. Pte. asked Elder Garcia what the Atonement was, and Elder Garcia started crying. Through his tears he said, "La Expiación es todo." What a powerful statement. The Atonement is everything. Watching Elder Garcia struggling to do push-ups for our chocolate, my chocolate, changed my way of thinking about the Atonement. Actually watching the suffering was different. Christ struggled an uncomprehensible amount of pain for our sins, for my sins. It helped me put in perspective what it was like for Him, obviously on a much bigger scale, for a much bigger prize. Jesus Christ, the Reedemer of the World, the only perfect man to walk the earth, suffered, bled, and died for my sins. And He was also resurrected for me. What a blessing it is to have the Atonement of Jesus Christ in our lives. May we all remember what I learned from that activity. The Atonement is everything.</div>

<br/>I love you all and wish you a happy week!<br/>Love ya!<br/><br/>Elder Kelley</div>

Hello everyone!<br/><br/><div>
Its been a great week for sure! Not many notable things have happened really, but thats how it goes sometimes. But that doesn't mean that it can't be a good week!<br/></div>
<div>
Well to start off, almost everyday this week it has rained. And not just rained, but POURED. Like crazy rain. The day starts off the same. Sunny and hot in the morning. But around 1ish the clouds show up and it rains like crazy for a bit, then drizzles for the rest of the day. Its actually kinda fun. I like the rain, just not so much when I have to walk in it... haha but its fun. I like to see how much water builds up in the streets and stuff. We were walking and there were a couple of intersections with about a foot of water!!! It was crazy! And the lightning is pretty cool. It is so frequent, and the thunder is super loud all the time too! Good times :)<br/></div>
<div>
Saturday we had our first English class! Of course I'm the teacher :) haha But we just covered the alphabet, vowel sounds, and personal pronouns. It went really well. We had 21 people in total, only 3 investigators, but we hope that will improve more and more! But it went really well, and I felt that everyone was learning and having a good time. </div>
<div>
<br/>We also had interviewts this week. My interviews went well. But my interview with Hermana Faúndez was the coolest. It was the first time that I felt like she was a mother figure. She asked me about things in my life that only a mother would ask about. And she knows me. She mentioned a few of the things that I do and the characteristics that I have. It reminded me of talking with you mom :) It was cool.</div>
<div>
<br/>Well other than that, I've got nothing to share... I know its not a lot, but there was a lot last week. But I've read a lot and studied a lot this week and learned a lot! I just can't remember any quotes or scriptures... I can just remember something I read in the Gordon B. Hinckley manual that stood out for me. Here it is: "Humble yourselves and walk in obedience." I don't know why it stuck with me, but it did. Humility and obedience go together! Well thats all I got! I love you all and hope you all have a fabulous week! Live it up!</div>

Hello family and friends!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Its been quite the week! We've done a lot and its really been a great week! Plus it was a lot faster than the last two weeks! haha One of the more insignificant achievements of the week, we made rice krispy treats! haha It actually turned out well, they were just really hard because we used radioactive marshmallows (not really, just Guatemalan marshmallows)! haha They were really good! We just had to mircrowave them a bit to soften them up!<br/>
<br/>
Now for the more important stuff ;)</div>
<div>
<br/>
We had a cool experience this week with a drunk, homeless man. We've seen him before and talked with him just a little tiny bit. He is the brother of a member. He has a really big drinking problem. So thats why he doesn't have a home. So we were sitting on a corner the other day taking a quick ice cream break and he came and aproached us. He wasn't drunk, or not that I could tell, but he wasn't all there... Anyways we talked with him for a bit and he started talking about all his problems, that he didn't have a home or any food, and that he was beat up the night before. Then he started crying. It was really sad, and I felt it for him. One of those feelings where you feel for someone right in your heart. We decided to do something about it. We went really fast over to the nearest panandería, bakery, and bought some bread and bananas. When we got back to where he was he was sleeping. It was more like a little nap, but we called his name and he woke up. You should have seen the look on his face when we handed him the bread and bananas! He started crying, this time tears of joy, and was so happy. Seeing the change of his face when we gave him the food was something special. I felt a genuine feeling of charity at that moment. I truely felt as if I was acting in place of the Savior. It was a very special moment. </div>
<div>
<br/>
This Saturday we had the opportunity to hear from Sister Duncan and Sister Renlund!!! Their husbands were both in Senahu creating a Stake there!!! Anyways, it was a special day too. 3 zones got together on Saturday, and we listened to them. They both gave their messages in English and two Sister Missionaries translated for them! So it was fun. But I learned a lot about God's love and how to be joyful in all circumstances! It was really powerful listening to them and learning from them! And also for the meeting our zone prepared a hymn to sing. We sang Hope of Israel. It was awesome! We sang the parts and it sounded great! I was rockin' the bass! </div>
<div>
<br/>
In my studies this week I've been enjoying reading from Doctrine and Covenants. And I've also been learning from the Teachings of President Hinckley! I've actually found a lot of cool scriptures that way! Proverbs 11:14 talks about leadership. Proverbs 22:6 talks about teaching children. Proverbs 27:23 also talks about leadership. 1 Thessalonians 5:16 is this: "Rejoice evermore." What a great scripture! And the next verse, verse 17 is this: "Pray without ceasing." Two very short, very powerful scriptures!! I invite you all to look up and read and ponder those 5 scriptures! They are all really short, but have a great impact! And I read a few cool talks too! One I read is by President Uchtdorf called Love of God given in October 2009. I got two cool quotes from it. "Though we are imcomplete, God loves us completely. Though we are imperfect, He loves us perfectly. Though we may feel lost and without compass, God's love encompasses us completely." Cool! God loves us in whatever state or shape we come in! He loves us more than we can comprehend! Another one from the same talk is this: "Love is the guiding light that illuminates the disciple's path and fills our daily walk with life, meaning, and wonder. Love is the measure of our faith, the inspirations for our obedience, and the true altitude of our discipleship." Another great one! Love is so important in our daily lives. We need to do more to focus on the first and great commandment. Because love really does guide our paths as disciples of Jesus Christ. Another cool quote I found is from Elder Weatherford T. Clayton from this last conference. He said, "Even in our moments of deepest grief, in the moments when time stands still and life seems so unfair, we can find comfort in our Savior because He suffered as well." What a beautiful way to describe the Atonement. Christ suffered so He take upon Him our sufferings, so He could understand what we are going through. Christ always knows how we feel, and how to help us. What a great blessing it is to know that.</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well thats what I've got for the week! I hope you are all doing well and that you are happy! I hope you are all trying your best to be your best! Have a great week and live it up!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

p.s. We've had some sweet lightning storms the last few nights! But its weird, because in the afternoon there is thunder, and in the night, just lightning. Its so cool!</div>

<br/>
<div>
Well its been a pretty good week! And it passed by so fast again! We had our Multi-Zone Conference, and it went well. Me and Elder Martinez talked about the Premortal Life and the Life on Earth. We based the teaching on the Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement. I read Elder McKonkie's talk on the Three Pillars of Eternity. I think it went well... haha We also went to Tanchi for a baptismal interview. On the way back I got super car sick and I almost exploded in more than one way... haha The medicine I am taking for parasites is kinda wacky, but its doing its job. I think I got more car sick than normal because of that... Oh well.</div>
<div>
<br/>
We taught our investigator Emilio this week. I don't know if I've talked about him yet. We found him about 2 or 3 weeks ago. He is 74, and knows a lot! He is reading the Book of Mormon, and he knows its true! We just need to get him to come to church! </div>
<div>
<br/>
I have been studying a lot too, like always. While I was reading in Doctrine and Coventants 90, I learned something really cool. Verse 24 says this: "Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good, if ye walk uprightly and remember the covenant wherewith ye have covenanted one with another." All things shall work together for our good if we do those things: search diligently, pray always, be believing, walk uprightly, and keep covenants. What a great promise! The footnote C is pretty great too. I recommend studying D&amp;C 90:24, especially footnote C. :D and Psalm 27:1 is pretty great! The Lord is my light. The Lord is my strength. Whom shall I fear? And Doctrine and Covenants 93:36-37 has some great insights too. It talks about the glory and intelligence of God.</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well I know I didn't write a lot this week, but thats how it goes. I'm glad you are all doing well. I'm thankful for your love, prayers, and support. You are the best! I love you and hope you have a fantastic week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

</div><h1>Divisions, parasites, and a baptism!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-1601255099990834455" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
This week has been a great one! Lots of things happened, and really it was one of the fastest weeks I've had for a while! So here we go!</div>
<div>
<br/>
On Tuesday morning Elder Martinez and I took a bus to Fray Bartolome las Casas. Fray is the area that was opened three weeks ago. It is part of our zone, so we went and did divisions with them. So the bus ride was 3 hours and 10 minutes. It was rough, because no one opened their windows! It was so hot! We got to Fray, and the other missionaries met up with us and we went with them to their house. There are 4 missionaries there, so Elder Martinez went with one companionship, and I went with the other. I went with Elder Pin and Elder Juarez. It was great! The people in Fray are the best! They are so nice and receiving! Every person we contacted let us in and we had a lesson with them. Plus it was great being with Elder Pin again! The climate in Fray is very hot! And it was sunny all day long! That never happens in Cobán! haha For the first time in a long time I saw a sunset and I saw the stars!!! On Wednesday we had District Meeting, and Elder Recio taught. It was great! I learned so much! After that we ate together, and me and Elder Martinez left to Cobán. On the way back we made the trip in 2 hours and 40 minutes! The bus driver was going so fast! And it was a lot better because we opened the windows and so it was nice and cool. </div>
<div>
<br/>
On Friday I woke up and had stomach problems again... But the thing is that it was the same exact pain that I felt two weeks ago. So I thought maybe it was caused by the same thing... So I did my best to hydrate to not have the same problem pass like last time... On Satuday I took a parasite test, because the nurse told me to. So I did that, and later in the day the nurse called and told me I have parasites... First time in the mission! I made it almost one year in the field without getting parasites! So I don't really know what caused it, because I think I've had the parasites for about 3ish weeks now... But I have medicine already, so life is good. </div>
<div>
<br/>
Saturday was great because I went to two baptisms! First we went to the baptism of Alex Osla, the Hermano that I was able to teach! It was great! I was able to be a witness for the baptism too. The Spirit was so strong! It was really great! Then we had our baptism. Mary got baptised! Everything went well. It was really special to be dressed in all white again! It was really special to baptize her too. I was actually pretty nervous because it was the first baptism I've done in the mission, and the first one in Spanish. But with the help of the Lord, everything went well. I said the prayer right, and baptized her right the first time! The water was freezing! Haha Afterwards I could literally see the difference in Mary. I could see she was changed. And of course on Sunday she was confirmed. Elder Martinez confirmed her, and Obispo Choc and I helped. It was really spiritual. In the baptism too, obviously I felt the Spirit. What a blessing it is to be an instrument in God's hands in this His work!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well not much else is going on... We are still working hard, and finding people to teach. On Sunday we taught Sunday School and it went well, and this week we have a Multizone Conference and we're gonna teach. Its gonna be great! I'm learning and reading a lot! Life is good, and alls well. Couldn't say more. I hope you all have an excellent week! </div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>
Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>Ma sa leech'ool?</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-2775387920822530843" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hi family!<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
This is when you all say, sa qach'ool! haha This week has been a good one! We've had our fair share of ups and downs, but we've mostly had ups! :D Well lets get to it!<br/><br/>This week we have had success. We are teaching Mary, our best investigator right now! She is getting baptized this Saturday!!! She is the one that lives with members, Familia Ovalle. We had two lessons with her this week, and she understands it all! She is so great. She expressed to us her desire to get baptized and change her life for the good! The Spirit was so strong! We also found a few new investigators this week too. They are really interested, and one is already reading the Book of Mormon! We are working hard to find new people to teach, but knocking doors is really uneffective. We are working with the members to find references! Something on the down side is Lorena. A little note beforehand: she worked in a tortilleria and we always taught her there. She worked with a few other women, and lives with them. So we went to the tortilleria, and her co-workers told it to us. Lorena had been a little rebelious and didn't come to work for a few days and then would show up out of no where. They told us that they let her go. So Lorena now lives with her family again, and doesn't live in our area. So we aren't teaching Lorena anymore. It was sad, but thats the way it works sometimes. On a little more positive side, last week the girls of the Familia Ibarra got baptized!!! </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Elder Vargas and I first found them about 5 or 6 months ago! The 3 girls finally got baptized! Awesome! And also Alex Osla, who we were teaching before the ward split and area change, is going to get baptized this Saturday too! It makes me happy that they are taking this step in their salvation! And I'm happy I could play a part in it! <br/><br/>Here are some of the lil tidbits I've found studying this week. Doctrine and Covenants 81:5 is really cool! It says, "Wherefore, be faithful; stand in the office which I have appointed unto you; succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees." In whatever calling or position we have, we should always serve and help our fellow men. I thought of a lot more stuff, but its hard to express it... Oh well. And I found this quote too. Its by Heber J. Grant. He said, "That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do; not that the nature of the thing changed, but that our power to do is increased." Wow what a great thought! Diligence helps us learn better how to do things. The harder we try to do something, the better we can do it. And its not that it is easier, but that we are better at doing it! This quote helped me realize that I really am making progress here! Its a different way at looking at diligence. <br/><br/>This week we also had interviews with Presidente Faúndez and the Asistentes. It went well. With the APs, they helped us realized the importance of language study. The next morning Elder Martinez and I had language study together. Elder Martinez is going to help me learn Q'eqchi'! It gave me a new desire to learn Q'eqchi', and I have been working on it for a few days now. I can pray in Q'eqchi' now! It is very short and simple, but I'm working on it! So that is what I am trying to do, work on learning Q'eqchi'! <br/><br/>Well thats all I got this week! I hope all is well for everyone up in Utah! As for me, I'm here in Cobán, working hard, and enjoying the rain! I love you all and wish you all a very swell week!<br/><br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

(sent July 10th)<br/>
Hi family!<br/>
<div>
<br/>
Well the subject line of this letter might be concerning to a few, namely Mom, but don't worry. I'll get to that a bit later! haha Well this week has been good! A few ups and downs, but thats life! </div>
<div>
<br/>
To start, on Tuesday morning Elder Reyes left along with the other missionaries leaving. It was harder than I thought to say bye to him! Dang I love that guy! He taught me so much! So from that point I've been runnin' with Elder Martinez! Alls well with him. We work well together, and he is a very good teacher! We've been working hard in our area, and we've been helping the Zone too! Elder Martinez and I made a plan for this change on Wednesday. We have divisions planned and we have plans to go to District Meetings too. Communication is going to be key this change because 2 of our 3 districts are really far away! So we've been calling each District Leader every night to see how they are doing and to see how their district is doing. Everything is going well! As for our area, we are working hard, but things are hard. We went with Lorena on Tuesday and she told us she doesn't want to get baptized anymore... It was sad, but obviously we didn't leave it at that! We are helping her to gain a better, more secure testimony of the gospel. Another one of our investigators, Mary, is also progressing really well. But we weren't able to meet with her this week, because her plans changed and couldn't meet with us. And in the entire week we contacted for about 8ish hours in total, and only found 3 new investigators... Sure we found lots of future investigators, but yeah. Things aren't exactly easy, but if they weren't, we wouldn't get better! Elder Martinez and I have already made plans to use our time better and improve our abiliy to find new investigators. We have plans to ask for a bunch of references from the members! Hopefully everything will work out and we'll be able to meet more people through those means! </div>
<div>
<br/>
Now to explain the subject line. This week I've been sick. Tuesday I had some stomach problems. Wednesday and Thursday I was just fine. But on Friday it all happened. I spent my fairshare of time in the bathroom. My stomach didn't hurt too bad at the time to go out, so I decided to take a shot at it. We were contacting, and we met a guy and had a really great lesson with him! We left his house and at the very next house was when it started. My comp was talking to the lady, and all at once I felt super light-headed. I felt like I was going to throw up, so I just walked away from the door and went and sat on the curb. My comp finished the contact and I was just sitting there. I leaned on my backpack for a bit and then felt good enough to keep get up. We started walking to the house, and about 30 feet later I got even more light-headed than the first time. I sat down on the curb again, and leaned on the wall. We were right next to a little store, or something, so some people asked what was going on. They all were saying how pale I was, so they told me to lay down. I put my backpack down, and layed down. They brought a little stool out too and elevated my legs. So I was laying there right on the side of the street for a few minutes. I just layed there with my eyes closed, and I really couldn't do anything else... haha There were a lot of people looking and trying to help. haha But someone called a taxi and we went to the house. I went to the bathroom, changed, and went to sleep. After sleeping, and drinking liquids I felt a lot better. I'm pretty sure that all happened because I was dehydrated. I didn't take into account that diarrhea causes dehydration. So thats basically what happened. Saturday I still was going to the bathroom a lot, but a lot less than Friday. I took some medicine, and asked for a Priesthood Blessing from Elder Martinez, and we went out and went to work. Since I got the blessing everything has been better! I haven't had diarrhea and I haven't had any stomach pain! The power of the Priesthood is real! So now, I'm doing just fine. I am still watching myself and making sure all is well. And I am staying hydrated too :P haha </div>
<div>
<br/>
This week I've been studying a lot and reading a lot. I read a lot from Jesus the Christ. I read the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew chapters 5-7, and then read in Jesus the Christ about the Sermon on the Mount. I learned so much! Its not really anything I can write about, but I really did learn a lot about what Jesus taught that day. Other than that studies are going well and all that :)</div>
<div>
<br/>
Well thats all I really got this week! I hope you are all doing well and enjoying the heat of summer! I am enjoying cool and rainy weather! Life is good! Things are working out. We are working hard. The Lord lives. He loves us. I love all of you so much! I hope you have one rockin' week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

(sent July 3)<br/>
Hey family!<br/>
<br/>
Things are going well here! We've had a good week and seen some great things! We've enjoyed our last week together and all in all life is good :)<br/>
<br/>
So Lorena has a fecha to get baptized on the 15th of this month. We have some last hoops to jump through so we can help her get baptized, so we are trying to get that figured out. And Mary is new to our teaching pool. She moved into the house of some members a few weeks ago, and she has already gone to church 3 times! She really likes it, and she told us she wants to get baptized! So we are teaching her, and we are going to put a fecha with her to get baptized the 22nd! <br/>
<br/>
Elder Reyes finishes his mission tomorrow! This last week we've been working really hard! Elder Reyes is the best, most dilligent missionary ever! It has been such a blessing to work with him! I've learned so much! So he is going home, and Elder Martinez is going to be my comp! He is from Mexico/Arizona, and we were in the MTC together, so it will be fun! Plus they reorganized our zone. They took the office Elders out of our zone, and gave us 4 Q'eqchi' areas! 2 in Chisec and 2 in Fray Bartolome. Its cool, because right now they are putting missionaries in Fray! There haven't been missionaries there for 25 years!!! So yeah, cool stuff!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
And on Saturday I finished reading Doctrine and Covenants in Spanish! It was great! I read it all in 39 days! I really learned a lot about how revelation works and how the Lord guides us in these Latter-Days. Good stuff :)<br/>
<br/>
Well thats all I got! Sorry! And the keyboard I'm using sucks, and the space bar doesn't really work. My WPM is at like 2... haha not really, but its rough! I must be in Guatemala! haha :D Well I love you all, and hope you are all doing well! Have a superb week!<br/>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>
Elder Kelley<br/>

Greetings from San Benito!<br/><br/><div>
Well hello everyone! This has been a really great week! It flew by! I got here on Tuesday morning with a few other missionaries that had a change to Petén. Since then I've been working with Elder Ruiz! He is great! We are always talking and joking around, and we are always happy :) We eat lunch everyday with Hna. Blanca. She is great too! Her food is great and she always gives us a TON! It is seriously a lot of food! haha The ward is great, and they are all willing to help! </div>
<div>
<br/>This week we had district meetings too, so I got to know all the missionaries in the zone! We went to an area called San Luis for a meeting and baptismal interview. We stayed the night there, because there weren't any more busses, but we knew that so we were prepared. San Luis is about 2 and a half hours from San Benito! </div>
<div>
<br/>Just like any other house, the house I'm at now was pretty dirty... We've been working on cleaning the house little by little. There were also a bunch of things that didn't work too, so we asked the utlilities guy (we live in a little condominuim place) to fix the problems, and he did. So now the house is better. I still have lots of things to clean, and improve, but its better than when I got here! haha And I actually really like getting things cleaned and organized. It gives me a sense of satisfaction. </div>
<div>
<br/>So everything here in San Benito is great! except for the heat. It is so hot here!!! The temperature hovers between 80 and 90 degrees all the time. I wake up and take a cold shower, and I am already sweaty by the time we have studies... haha I really am just really sweaty all the time! Its crazy! haha And we also have to sleep with big fans too. I hardly even use my little blanket. But the heat is good for a change I guess. But I miss the nice cool weather of Cobán! </div>
<div>
<br/>Well thats all I really have for this week! But all in all things are going really well, and we are working hard to help the missionaries in our zone! I love you all! I hope you all have a super awesome week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>Adios Cobán!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-2825792780963321346" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello!<br/><br/><div>
Well the time has finally come! I am leaving Cobán! I am being transferred to San Benito, Petén! My new companion will be Elder Ruiz, from Panamá. We also came in the same group, so I am already pretty good friends with him! Its gonna be great! I am sad to be leaving Cobán! I'm going to miss the nice cool weather! Most of all I'm going to miss the people that I've met here in the Ward! They are so great! We've been visiting a bunch of members yesterday and today so I can say good-bye to them. Its sad, but thats how the mission is. It helps me see how much I've come to love these people! </div>
<div>
<br/>Well other than that, I don't much else to say. This week was a good week. We met a lot of new people, and we walked A LOT. But alls well here :) </div>
<div>
<br/>Studies went well this week too. I finished reading Doctrine and Covenants again for the mission wide study. But this time I read it in English... And I also came across some good scriptures and a good Ensign article. Part of Proverbs 1:5 says, "A wise man will hear, and will increase learning;" I love learning about learning! haha A wise man will hear, or learn, and will increase his learning. Its simple, but very true! I came across an article in the March 2016 Ensign by Elder Larry Lawrence. Its called The Light of the Perfect Day. I really liked it! It talks about how we should seek spiritual learning to increase our spiritual light! I came across two more scriptures while reading the article. Part of 1 Peter 2:9 says, "ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:" Christ has called us out of darkness into his marvellous light! What a great thought! We have the gospel light in our lives, so we should help others to find the light as well! And part of 1 John 1:5 says, "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all." Simple. There is no darkness in our Heavenly Father. He is light. His son is light. Through them, we can be light too. What a great blessing it is that we can become like our Father in Heaven! </div>
<div>
<br/>Well thats all I got! I hope you are all doing well and loving life! I love you all! I wish you all a brilliant week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

Hello family and friends!<br/><br/>Wow! Another week gone! The time is flying so fast. Every week now, it is Tuesday, then Wednesday, then Monday again! haha Well I don't have a lot to share this week, but I want to share a few cool little experiences. <div>
<br/></div>
<div>
First we'll start on Sunday. After Sacrament Meeting, Elder Martinez and I were waiting outside the Bishop's office to talk to him and the person he was with. While waiting we were looking through the Teachings of President Hinckley book. I showed Elder Martinez a picture that was in the book of someone what I knew in high school. A little bit later we flipped to a page with the picture of Christ's prayer in Gethemane, and I said, hey I know Him too! What I said was small and simple. But right after I said that I felt the Spirit touch my heart. What a simple truth, but what a powerful feeling I felt. I know Jesus, and He knows me. I love Him, and He loves me. Like I said, it was something small, but it strengthened my testimony of Christ. Its amazing how and when the Spirit works!</div>
<div>
<br/><div>
Now we'll move to Saturday. We were out doing the normal stuff. We got to an investigator's house 10 minutes earlier than he told us. So we decided to wait a few minutes before knocking. After about 6 or 7 minutes we knocked again. We ended up knocking a few times, but he never answered... Then I turned around and noticed that the house across the street had a bunch of plants and little cacti displayed. For some reason I had never noticed that before, so we went and contacted the house. A lady let us into her yard, and we talked with her for a while about her plants, and all that. It was really fun! I even bought a little cactus! haha But we talked with her a lot longer than I thought we would, and when we left, it felt like we left abruptly, and I didn't know why. But then it happened. Alex Osla, the man I taught a while ago and who got baptized 2 weeks ago, drove by on his moped and stopped us. We talked with him and he expressed some of the difficulties that were happening in his life. We were able to to help him, and remind him of his baptismal covenant, and overall just help him feel better. I even used the little cactus that I bought to make an illustration. But what I gained out of that experience was an understanding how the Lord uses His servants to help His children. We were in the place we needed to be, at the time we needed to be there to help Alex. If we left even a minute earlier from the lady's house, we would have missed him. It was a special experience for me. It helps me know that the Lord trusts me to use me as an instrument in His hands. And it wasn't a coincedence that we were there in that area, and that everything happened like it did. It was so cool! </div>
<div>
<br/>Well thats all I got! Some other little things are that today we played ping pong as a district! It was a blast! We used the golf whiffle ball that I found. It definitely isn't a real ping pong ball, but it worked. We also played volleyball. And we all used the Zone shirts I designed! We got them last week and we all wore them today! They look great! And also I've started doing excersize in the morning. Manda gave me some papers before the mission, and I found a paper with a 7-minute workout on it. So thats what I've been doing... haha Its not a lot, but its enough to get my heart pumping, and I actually feel a lot better during the day after doing it. So yeah, good times. </div>
<div>
<br/>Well thats it! I love you guys and hope you are all doing well. I love hearing from you all each week. I love being out here in Cobán! I am learning a lot, and having a blast! I love you all, and have a fantastic week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>My week...</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-6116550757985891289" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Well to start off this week had a lot of ups and downs. </div>
<div>
<br/>
First of all our investigators didn't get baptized this week. Arelis had a family emergency, and with Sandi there was a lack of communication... But they are both going to get baptized the same day as Ivan, on  October 7th!  So thats whats going on with our investigators.</div>
<div>
<br/>
We got changes this weekend! Elder Ruiz had a change and is leaving. My new companion will be Elder Nielsen! If any of you remember, he is from Riverton! He and I went to Riverton High together, and worked at Geckos together! Now we are comps! Cool huh?! So we will be working together this change :)</div>
<div>
<br/>
I read a lot more about the Gifts of the Spirit this week, but I left my study notes at the house! So I don't have any quotes to share on that. But I was reading something really cool from  the Teachings of President Hinckley. So I will share that. This is a part from the 25th chapter: "Long ago I worked for one of our railroads whose tracks threaded the passes through [the] mountains. I frequently rode the trains. It was in the days when there were steam locomotives. Those great monsters of the rails were huge and fast and dangerous. I often wondered how the engineer dared the long journey through the night. Then I came to realize that it was not one long journey, but rather a constant continuation of a short journey. The engine had a powerful headlight that made bright the way for a distance of 400 or 500 yards. The engineer saw only that distance, and that was enough, because it was constantly before him all through the night into the dawn of the new day. …<br/>
<br/>
"And so it is with our eternal journey. We take one step at a time. In doing so we reach toward the unknown, but faith lights the way. If we will cultivate that faith, we shall never walk in darkness.<br/>
<br/>
"The challenge which faces every member of this Church is to take the next step, to accept that responsibility to which he is called, even though he does not feel equal to it, and to do so in faith with the full expectation that the Lord will light the way before him."<br/>
<br/>
What a cool story and how its related to faith! Faith lights the way. We will never walk in darkness if we have faith. I really love how President Hinckley explained this. I found the talk that this came from, and I am going to read it this week!   <br/>
<br/>
Well other than that I don't have anything else to share! I am doing well. I am happy and  trying to be better every day!  I love you all so much! Have a fantastic week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>
Elder Kelley</div>

</div>
Hello everyone!<div>
<br/>Time is flying like crazy! Another week gone! Wow. Well we had another week of work, learning, and success! </div>
<div>
<br/>To start off, this week we've seen the progress of a few investigators, and we've met some new people who are interested as well. Our main investigators right now are Sandy, Arelis, Johny, and Ivan. Sandy is the girlfriend of a member named Edward, and Arelis is living with the Bishop's family. </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Both Sandy and Arelis are going to get baptized this Saturday!!! We are working with them and we are really happy that they are going to take this step! Johny is a friend of Edward, and is interested as well. This week we are doing to invite him to get baptized! And Ivan is a 9 year old boy whose parents are members but he isn't baptized yet. He is going to get baptized on October 7th. So right now we are doing well and working hard, and we are about to see the fruits of our labors! But get me right - I know none of this would be possible without the help of the Lord. This is His work! In our zone we have 6 investigators who are going to get baptized this Saturday! This is going to happen because of the zone fasting chain we did! Fasting works! :D</div>
<div>
<br/>We also had a Multi-Zone Conference this week. It went really well and I learned a lot, and told of the things I need to improve. It was great! Our lesson went well, and the other missionaries' lessons went well. Presidente Faúndez's message was the best! I learned so much! And yesterday Elder Arredondo, a Seventy, came to our ward and spoke! It was awesome! He talked about how great it is that we have the gospel in our lives and talked about light and how we need to share it. I learned a lot, and when he bore his testimony at the end I felt the Spirit. It was such a great feeling. :)</div>
<div>
<br/>Well this week I enjoyed my study times! And I read yet another talk about the gifts of the spirit. It is actually an article from the Feburary 2002 Ensign. Its called Gifts of the Spirit by Elder Robert D. Hales. Here are a few quotes that I pulled from the article that I like. "I urge you each to discover your gifts and to seek after those that will bring direction to your life’s work and that will further the work of heaven." We are all given gifts of the spirit. We need to discover and develop these gifts, so that we can find direction in our lives, and so that we can help bring about Heavenly Father's eternal plan. "Humility and submissiveness to God will always be fundamental in receiving direction from Him." I really liked this one because it is very important. Humility and submissiveness help us receive revelation and help from our Heavenly Father. And the last one I found in the article comes from George Q. Cannon "If any of us are imperfect, it is our duty to pray for the gift that will make us perfect." This is a really cool concept; that we can pray for gifts that will help us, and that will ultimately help build the kingdon of God. </div>
<div>
<br/>Well thats what I have to share this week! I am happy and healthy and loving life. I got to play ping pong twice this week and it was the best!!! Elder Ruiz is really good! haha I love you and and miss you a ton, but I know I need to be here. I trust the Lord in all things and I am trying to be a better instrument in His hands every day! Have an excellent week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>The Gospel Plan to Happiness</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7105404747728992690" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello!<div>
<br/>Well another week gone! Wow! This week was a good one! Lots of normal stuff happened again, and all went well. We are working hard and helping the missionaries in our zone too! And yes we heard about the earthquake, and it was felt were we are at, but I didn't feel it! haha There were a few missionaries who felt it, but it was small and everyone is okay :) Also this week we were in a trio. Elder Balboa was with us because his companion, Elder Alvarado, was in the hospital for the week. He left today, so they both returned to their area.</div>
<div>
<br/>This week we didn't have a ton of time to study because we had a lot of zone leader duties to attend to. But I read a cool talk and an awesome article! I read another talk about the gifts of the Spirit. And I got a cool quote from it. Marvin J. Ashton said, "Our capacity to see and comprehend is increased only in proportion to our willingness to look." I love this! It has to do with the seek and ye shall find principle. The more we seek the more we find! I also read an article from the Liahona for this month. Its by Elder Holland and its called The Gospel Path to Happiness. I want you all to read it! I read it this morning, and I loved it! There are so many great quotes and ideas in the article, but I will only share a few of the best. Elder Holland quotes the words of Henry David Thoreau, "Happiness is like a butterfly; the more you chase it, the more it will elude you, but if you turn your attention to other things, it will come and sit softly on your shoulder." Elder Holland used this quote because the quest for happiness is different from happiness itself. We need to to things that will bring happiness into our lives. Here is a quote Elder Holland used from President McKay, "happiness is found only along that well beaten [gospel] track, narrow as it is ... [and] straight [as it is], which leads us to life eternal." Only when we live the gospel can we find happiness. And these are the words of Elder Holland, "If you want to be happy in school or on a mission or at a job or in a marriage - work at it. Learn to work. Serve dilligently." The key to being happy is work! I know that is true, because I've seen that here on the mission. When I work, I am happy. Simple as that. So like I said, I want to all to read that talk! I will add the link to it at the end of the letter.</div>
<div>
<br/>Well as for the work here in San Benito, all is well! We have a few good investigators. Sandy is our best one right now. She has a baptismal date for the 23rd of this month! We are trying to find other people to teach, and we have received a lot of references, so we are going to work with them. And as for the zone, we are all doing well and working together! We did a fasting chain this week and we definitely saw the fruits of the fast! At the start of the week as a zone we had zero baptismal dates, and now we have 5! We are working hard! The best thing that happened this week was that we put a fecha with Sandy, and the worst thing that happened this week is that Sandy couldn't come to church.<br/>Well thats what I got for you this week! I am doing well and loving life! I am happy and working on doing more things to be more happy :) I love you all and I hope you all have a superb week!</div>

Hi family!<br/><br/>Well I got thinking, and I don't really have anything to share this week! Hmm... Obviously lots happened, but not really much to talk about... haha We traveled back to San Benito after being in Cobán on Monday. we worked all week. We had our District Meetings and all went well. We had a Ward activity and it went well, even though it was an outdoor activity and it started to rain.<br/><br/><div>
Something that I have been doing is studying a lot! I am doing my New Testament study plan again, and I've read a ton! I am reading it in Spanish. I am learning a lot! I don't know why a lot of the NT stuff didn't stick with me in Seminary. But alls good because I am reading and learning! And I am reading the Book of Mormon in Spanish focusing on the Atonement of Jesus Christ! Its been pretty great! I started this week and haven't read a ton, so I haven't found a lot yet, but I'll get there! And I read the talk I got in my birthday package. It was about Spiritual Gifts. When I read the talk, I didn't know that I needed to hear that! I learned a TON! It was great! :D<br/><br/>Among other things, we completed the zone baptism goal for last month, so we could do a zone activity. Today we went to Yaxha'. It is like Tikal, but smaller. So we were there in the morning, and it was great because we had the entire place to ourselves! We only saw 5 other tourists the whole time! It was really fun! And another great thing was that I ate hobnobs for the first time in 4 years!!! It was the greatest thing ever! Thanks Manda! haha <br/><br/>Well thats all I got! I am doing well and we are working hard! I love you all and I hope you all have a rockin' week!<br/><br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>Una semana difícil</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7310251835657785549" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello!<br/><br/><div>
Well this week was long and hard. Really it was one of the hardest and least successful of my mission. We worked hard everyday and visited people everyday, but it just didn't pan out. Almost every person we visited wasn't home, or didn't have time for us. Saturday was the only successful day. We found 4 new inv.s on the week, and we found them all on Saturday morning. Saturday afternoon every plan A and/or plan B worked out. So Saturday was a good day, but it was just really hard the other days of the week... So yeah.</div>
<div>
  <br/>So today we are in Cobán. We have our montly leaders meeting tomorrow morning. I read President Nelson's conference talk this week, but I left it at home. So I don't have my study notes with me, but I do remember this quote that I liked. "My dear brothers and sisters, I promise that as you prayerfully study the Book of Mormon every day, you will make better decisions—every day. I promise that as you ponder what you study, the windows of heaven will open, and you will receive answers to your own questions and direction for your own life. I promise that as you daily immerse yourself in the Book of Mormon, you can be immunized against the evils of the day." We need to read the Book of Mormon everyday! It truely gives us power against the evils of our day. </div>
<div>
<br/>Sorry I don't have anything else to write. Elder Nielsen and I are working hard and trying to find more success. Hopefully this week will be better! I love you all and I hope you all have a stellar week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley<div>

</div><h1>Apple juice, apple juice flood</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-8207873999046096048" itemprop="description articleBody">
October 23, 2017<br/><br/>¡Hola!<br/>Another week down! This week started off really slow, but then it sped up a ton, and its already Monday again! This week was good and we had the chance to help a lot of people.<div>
<br/>To start off, there has been a lot of flooding here in Guatemala lately (water floods, not apple juice floods). So our Stake worked together with the government leaders in Petén to make food kits for the effected areas here. So on Thurdsay we did humanitarian service! It was a blast! We moved a ton of food from trucks into the cultural hall by way of fire brigade line. Then we made the kits by setting everything down in piles, everyone putting their item into the pile. Then we bagged the kits, and then took the bags to trucks. We also took big jugs of water out to the trucks too. Then we went out and distributed it to people! It was a lot of work, but it was really fun! I liked the logistics of it. But I got really dirty and sweaty in my chuch clothes, but it was part of the fun! haha But when we were passing out the kits, I took one to an older man. He described to us that the water flooded his house up to his knees, and that he didn't have any food for a few days. And then he started to cry. It really touched my heart. It helped me realize the work that we were doing really was paying off. It was a cool experience. I was so sore afterwards! It was hard work! But like I said, it was totally worth it!</div>
<div>
<br/>We are working with some new people lately. We have found a lot of new people, and the mose promising people are people from part-member families. We found a few inactive families this week with non-member family members. So we are working with them. And this week we invited 3 people, and 2 families to church. But the sad thing is that none of them showed up... It was hard because we invited them all and they all said yes. So thats what we are going to work on. </div>
<div>
<br/>This week I read Elder Andersen's talk from this conference. Its called The Voice of the Lord. These are a few good quotes. "There is a treasure chest of heavenly direction awating your discovory in the messages of general conference." I like this because we all know that we can learn more by rereading and studying the conference talks. But there is a treasure chest of heavenly direction awating us! Here is another one, "The teachings of general conference are the considerations the Lord would have before us now and in the months ahead." The Lord leads this church. He speaks though his chosen servants. They give us the messages we need to hear in every conference. So we need to hear and obey what they say! And I really liked that Elder Andersen shared a few lines from the talk Elder Hales was going to give. Elder Hales wrote, "Our faith prepares us to be in the presense of the Lord." I really liked this one, and based my conference quote drawing off it. It helps us realize just how important faith is. Sometimes we think that faith is such an easy, simple thing, but it is really so much more. </div>
<div>
<br/>So thats what I've got for you this week! I am doing well and I am happy as always :) We are working hard and loving life! I love you all! Have an outstanding week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>Sunshine all the time</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-1390232428429817665" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Another great week has come to pass. We've been working more than ever trying to find more peope to teach! Elder Nielsen and I have been contacting, or tracting, every morning this week! Its been really tiring, but we've found more people that way! Anyways, its been a tiring week, but a good one :)<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
Tuesday we had a Multi-Zone Conference. It went really well. We talked about Faith in Jesus Christ. We used the Bible Video Substance of Faith and it was really good. And we learned a lot over all too. I always love listening and learning from Presidente Faúndez! He is the best! <br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
I also read President Uchtdorf´s talk this week called Bearers of Heavenly Light. It is my favorite. It is amazing. I want to quote it all because it is so good, so you all just need to read it. I'll put the link at the bottom so its that much easier to read! haha But a quote that I liked a lot from the talk was "The light of Christ fills the universe." I did a drawing of it! :D <br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
I have been stuying light this week. So I found a cool scripture. In Isaiah 9:2 (also 2 Nephi 19:2) it says, "The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined." Cool huh! It gets better too! The footnote for 'darkness' says that the darkness was apostacy and captivity. And the footnote explains that Jesus Christ is the 'great light.' So anyone who has walked in darkness, being apostacy and/or captivity, has or can see the great light that is Jesus Christ. Even the people that live in the land of the shadow of death can see the light. Christ's light can reach us all. Like President Uchtdorf said, the light is always shining, it is us that move into spiritual darkness. We need to do all that is possible to stay in Christ's light! <br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
Well thats what I got for you this week. My week has gone well. I am happy and healthy :) Today we spend 4 hours cleaning the house, because we both realized that we didn't need to live like we did. The house is so much cleaner now!!! I've said it before and I'll say it again, I am grateful for a mother that taught me how to clean, and why to clean. Thanks mom! :D So yeah, life is good. I love you all. Thank you for your prayers. Have an excellent week!<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
Love ya!<br/>

Hi everyone!<div>
<br/>Well this week was a good one! We worked hard and we had three baptisms this Saturday!</div>
<div>
<br/>So on Saturday Sandy, Arelis, and Ivan got baptized! It was really great. Ivan asked me to baptize him, so it was even more special. Everything worked out well, and they all got confirmed on Sunday. Elder Nielsen confirmed Ivan, and I was asked to confirm Arelis. It was the first time that I had done a confirmation, so it was really special as well :) </div>
<div>
<br/>Well other than that, not much happened out of the ordinary. We are working, we are helping the missionaries in the zone. Its still hot. I am happy and healthy. I am sorry, but I am really drawing a blank on anything else... Well we had interviews with Presidente Faúndez yesterday, and it went really well. I love talking with Presidente one on one! He knows what to tell me to help me. </div>
<div>
<br/>So anyways, I am doing well. Life is good. I hope you are all doing well. I love you all! Have a fantastic week!</div>

</div><h1>Stay on the gospel path by having faith in every footstep</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-2375164530081777588" itemprop="description articleBody">
Greetings!<br/><br/><div>
Well this week was a good one! And we finished it off with an amazing General Conference! </div>
<div>
<br/>So this week Elder Nielsen and I became companions! Its actually been really fun being together! Its been a little baggy, because we've talked about home a bit, but its all good. haha And part of the changes is that they added Hermanas to our ward. So now we split the ward area in two! So 2 of our 3 investigators with baptismal dates are in their area now! They are still going to get baptized thought! And we are going to help Ivan get baptized this Saturday too! Your prayers will be apprecieated!</div>
<div>
  <br/>Okay, now lets get to the good stuff: General Conference! First of all, I was able to watch 4 of the 5 sessions in English! We watched the Saturday Morning Session in Spanish. But it was all so amazing! I learned so much! First off, the subject line has the words of Elder Ballard. I really liked how he talked about faith and the pioneers. I had been reading up about faith in the week, so it was a cool talk. I also really liked Elder Pingree's talk! He focused on helping others, and he even talked about spiritual gifts for a bit! And I've been studying that for a while now! And I think my favorite talk was President Uchtdorf's Priesthood Session talk! He talked about light, and wow I loved it a ton! I have been thinking about studying light more fully, and I think I will start after that talk! And another amazing talk was Elder Andersen's talk. I loved how he shared some of the words we heard in conference. He reminded us that we need to study and live the conference talks after the conference is over. And I think the most special thing about his talk, is that he shared the words of Elder Hales and of President Monson. It is sad that Elder Hales passed away, but I think it is very remarkable that he still had a conference talk ready to give. I am glad that Elder Andersen was able to share a few lines from that talk. And when Elder Andersen finished sharing the words of the Prophet, I felt the Spirit so strong! When Elder Andersen finished, I just wanted to stay in that moment, feeling the power of the Spirit bearing witness to me of the power and authority of God's chosen servants. Another thing that I really loved was how Presidents Eyring and Nelson showed us such examples of following the Prophet. Even thought they work so close with President Monson, and are Apostles themselves, they obviously still follow him! It was cool how so many talks were about reading and studying the Book of Mormon! It is really something that we NEED to do every day! We know that if we read the Book of Momon everyday that we will have more strength to resist sin and temptation. We will have the presence of the Holy Ghost more in our lives. What a great promise! So those are some of my insights to General Conference! I still think that its so crazy that I only have one conference left in the mission!</div>
<div>
<br/>I also found a talk from President Faust in the October 1999 General Conference about hope. I really liked it! This is a quote I got from it, "Hope is trust in God's promisies, faith that if we act now, the desired blessings will be fulfilled in the future." That really helps me know what hope is. Hope and faith go hand in hand. Hope is like an assurance that God will fulfill His end of the promises that we make with him. I really liked that :)</div>
<div>
<br/>Well among other things, we are in Coban today for a leaders meeting we had. It was great! I really love listening to Presidente Faundez's council. I trust him and love him. It was really special today listening to all his council. He is such an amazing man, and I am so grateful that I can learn from him! I am doing well. I am happy and healthy. We are meeting lots of people, and our zone is doing amazing as well. I love you all and hope you all have a superb week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/><br/>Elder Kelley</div>

Happy Thanksgiving to everyone!<div>
<br/>I hope you all had a wonderful Thankgiving with friends and family! As for us Hermana Blanca made us a great meal for lunch! She made us chicken cordon bleu, mahsed potatoes, and corn! It was great! </div>
<div>
<br/>Also this week we saw a few little successes that will help us have more success in December! We put a baptismal date with Shaidy for December, and we almost put another with Hna. Dina. Shaidy wasn't able to go to church on Sunday, so we will go with her this week to see why. Hna. Dina came to church, and was able to feel the Spirit and learn a lot. She is the mother of a memeber family. So we obviously have the family support for her! We will put a fecha with her this week for December too! </div>
<div>
<br/>This week I have something more substantial to share about my studies. So like you all know, I am reading the Libro de Mormon focusing on the Atonement of Jesus Christ. I found a few simple scriptures that talk about it, but they really help us understand the Atonement! The first is in Alma 9:27. The verse says, "And behold, he cometh to redeem those who will be baptized unto repentance, through faith on his name." I liked this, because it is something that is very easy to understand. I like sharing it with the people we visit. Christ redeems every person who is baptized unto repentance, and of course they need to have faith on His name. The second verse that I found is in Alma 11:40. Its says, "And he shall come into the world to redeem his people; and he shall take upon him the transgressions of those who believe on his name; and these are they that shall have eternal life, and salvation cometh to none else." I loved this verse as well, because it explains the some of the blessings of the Atonement. It says that Christ came to redeem those who believe on His name, thus invoking faith once again. And the blessing is eternal life, which we know is the highest gift our Heavenly Father can give us. Another part in this verse that helps to understand the Atonement is the last part. Salvation only comes to those who do those things: baptism, repentance, and faith on His name. So those were the verses that I found especially helpful this week. I also found another verse that I really liked that is found in 1 Corinthians 2:9. It says, "But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him." This is such an awesome scripture! We cannot even begin to comprehend the blessings that Heavenly Father has in store for us when we love Him. What a great thought! :D</div>
<div>
<br/>Well thats all I got for you all this week! I still can't believe that it is almost December. It seems like yesterday that we were starting 2017! Time flies! Well I hope that you all have a wonderful week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

Hello!<br/><br/><div>
Well another week down! Dang time is going by fast!</div>
<div>
<br/>This week was the best week Elder Nielsen and I have had together, so it was a good one! We met a lot of new people this week, and a lot of them show a lot of potential! Our most important investigator we have right now is named Shaidy. She was listening to the missionaries in Belize a few months back, but couldn't get baptized because she had to come here. She already knows the church is true and she is reading in Alma already! So she wants to get baptized, so we are going to put a fecha with her this week! We are seeing more success in our area, and in the zone as well. It looks like we will have lots of baptisms as a zone next month! </div>
<div>
<br/>Among other things, I started Alma this week in my Libro de Mormon reading. The Book of Mormon is great! And the Libro de Mormon is even better! haha Just kiding, its the same book. lol But I really like reading the BoM in Spanish. I really liked reading in Alma 5. Like I think I've said I am reading the LdM with a focus on the Atonement. Alma 5 talks a lot about it. I learned a lot. I really like verses 7 and 12. So you should read them :D</div>
<div>
<br/>Some other things are that today we played frisbee!!! It was a blast! We had a nice lil 3v3 game. It was really fun to play again, and its always funny playing with people who have never played before! But everyone learned really fast and we had a good time. I also found a lil box of eggnog today, so I bought it. It was alright... haha I'll send a pic. And I don't think I've mentioned this before, but Elder Nielsen introduced me to bagged chocolate milk a few weeks back. Its the best thing ever! haha But anyways at the store today we saw bagged strawberry milk for the first time, so we had to buy it. I haven't tried it yet, but I'm sure its great! haha </div>
<div>
<br/>Well I hope you all are doing well! I wish you all happy Thanksgiving! I love you all and hope you have an exceptional week!</div>
<div>

Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Well this week was a lot better than the last few weeks we've had. We had a lot of really good lessons, and there are a lot of people starting to pan out. Out biggest problem is getting people to church still, so thats what we are working on.</div>
<div>
<br/>
Out of everyone Vanesa, Renny, and Gysenia are the best people we have right now. Vanesa and Renny are both really interested, but they haven't come to church yet. Gysenia has been one of our investigators for a while, but right now she is showing more promise. So like I said, they are all doing what they need to, except coming to church! We are gonna make sure they come this week.</div>
<div>
<br/>
Something cool happened yesterday too. We went out to work, and our first two plans A fell through. Our backup plan for the second visit was contacting. I really didn't want to contact. We stopped at a corner to assess the situation. We talked for a few minutes and decided to contact at least two houses.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
There was a house on the other corner that I wanted to contact, so we went. We knocked on the door, and the people let us in. So we got talking and some of the people are members! They are visiting their family here. They are visiting from Canada. So we talked with them, and one of the Hno's nephews was there that wanted to investigate the church. So we taught him the Restoration. But the thing is is that the kid lives in the capital. But we were able to find those guys just like that! The Lord works in great ways! We are going to pass the reference to the missionaries in the capital so they can finish teachin and baptise Luis! It was really cool how everything worked out how everything fell through so we were guided to that house. Plus when we were teaching that lesson, Luis read the chapter heading to 3 Nephi 11, when Christ comes and visits the Nephites. While he read the heading, the Spirit came and touched my heart to reassure the truthfulness of the event. It was a cool experience.</div>
<div>
<br/>
I have been reading the Bible Dictionary this week too. I am not sure why, but I've learned a lot! haha Also this is a list of a few scriptures that I read this week that I want you all to read: Mosiah 16:9, Isaiah 50:11, and Romans 13:12. They are all pretty great! </div>
<div>
<br/>
Well I am still doing well. I am loving life and having a good time everyday! I hope you are all doing well as well. I love you all and I hope you have a fantastic week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

Hey!<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
So this week went well for the most part. It was kinda weird. The week started off really fast, then ended really slow... So yeah. We worked a lot, and it was a good week. But the thing is is that I don't have much to talk about...</div>
<div>
<br/>There were changes this weekend, but Elder Nielsen and I are staying together another change!! So that will be fun. </div>
<div>
<br/>We talked with a lot of people this week that have potential! We have goals to put a few baptismal dates with people this week. Its looking like we won't have anything until December, but we are workin' on it. </div>
<div>
<br/>I read in Mosiah 14 this morning. I am reading the Book of Mormon right now is Spanish, marking everything about the Atonement of Jesus Christ. I liked this chapter because it talks a lot about it. I like verses 3-5. So these are Isaiah's words:</div>
<div>
<br/>3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.<br/><br/>4 Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.<br/><br/>5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.<br/><br/>I like how Isaiah describes the Atonement here. There is so much feeling conveyed in these three verses. My favorite part its the last part of verse 5: with his stripes we are healed. We can be healed through Christ. He suffered and died for us. He was beaten and crucified for us. Thanks to the Atonement of Jesus Christ the Plan of Salvation can come to pass. I know Jesus lives, I know he loves us. Sé que Jesucristo vive, y que nos ama. Ninnaw naq li Jesukristo yo'yo, ut naq nokoxra.<br/><br/>Sorry I don't have anything else to share this week! I will try to find more to write more about next week! I love you all and I hope you all have a magnificent week!</div>

<div>
Our Christmas went really well. Yesterday we visited a bunch of families and they all gave us something to eat! And today we had lunch with a member and investigator, and then called you guys! It was great to see you all and talk to you! It was super mega awesome. I love you guys so much! :D I also opened the package that you sent, and it was great! I will be enjoying those little treats for a while! haha And I'm thankful for what the Relief Society sent me too! Thanks! But I am so happy to have a camera again!!! I have taken almost 50 pics just this week! Salamá is so photogenic! haha </div>

Que tal?<br/>
<br/>
<div>
Another week down everyone! Time is flyin! And also changes are today, and I have a change! I am going to Salamá, Baja Verapaz! My companion is Elder Godoy. He is from Honduras and he is pretty cool. So I won't be with Elder Nielsen in San Benito for Christmas, but life will go on. haha So I am in Cobán right now, and I will be going to Salamá tomorrow morning.<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
Other things that I wanted to mention is the weather. Remember how when I first got to San Bentito and I was dying of heat? Well this week I was freezing! There were several mornings in the week where I woke up and was super cold! I started sleeping with my hoodie and long pants! haha I never thought I would use my hoodie in Petén. haha But we don't have hot water either, so showering was cold! :D Good times. But in Salamá it is still warmer than Cobán but not as hot as Petén. <br/>
<br/></div>
<div>
In my studies this week I was reading in Alma, still. I liked a lot what I read in chapter 37. Verses 6 and 7 say this: "behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise. And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls." Last week I heard a lot about the small and simple things in life that make the difference, and then I read this! The small and simple things are so important in our lives. In verses 33 and 34 talk about teaching the gospel. "Preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ; teach them to humble themselves and to be meek and lowly in heart; teach them to withstand every temptation of the devil, with their faith on the Lord Jesus Christ. Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be meek and lowly in heart; for such shall find rest to their souls." Teaching the people the gospel of Christ is what helps them find rest to their souls. And verse 44 talks about the Liahona. "For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land." Basically it says that it is as easy to follow Christ as it was for Lehi and his family follow the directions of the Liahona. The words of Christ lead us to "eternal bliss." In Spanish it says "felicidad eterna," or eternal happiness. I like that one :) So those are a few little tidbits of my studies this week!<br/>
<br/>
I love you all and I hope you all have a fun week leading up to Christmas! I can't believe that I'll be able to see and talk to you in one week! Keep up the good work and remember that the Lord loves you! Have a festive week! :D<br/>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

Hola!<br/><br/><div>
We had another good week, and it went by really fast because we had lots to do!</div>
<div>
<br/>On Wednesday we had divisions with the Asistants. I was with Elder Acosta and he is a good friend of mine, so it was fun. Friday we had our MultiZone Conference and all went well. And on Sunday we had Stake Conference! Good times.</div>
<div>
<br/>So we had a really good MultiZone Conference. Our zone and the other Petén zones were there. We learned a lot, and then we did our Christmas presentation for Pte. and Hna. Faúndez and crew. So what we did is that everyone in the two zones was sining La Primera Navidad (The First Noel). Elder Nielsen played the piano, and Hna. Castro directed. And Elder Mendoza and I were the puppeteers! So we set up the projector and had little shadow puppets on sticks, so thats what Elder Mendoza and I were doing while everyone was singing. So while the people were singing, we were showing what they were singing. It was super awesome!!! Then after that we all received our presents from Pte. and Hna. Faúndez. But they dressed up as Santa and Mrs. Claus! It was awesone! :D haha Then we all got flu shots... Elder Nielsen helped the Nurse give shots, because he knows how to. So he gave me my shot. And I got to use Pte.s big camera to take pictures of everyone getting their shots! haha It was fun. After that we ate lunch and it was good, and after that we all changed into sport clothes and got to play! I brought my frisbee so I played 3v3!! It was so much fun! But I was so tired! After frisbee I played volleyball. It was a blast! So it was a really fun day. We learned, got presents, got shots, and played! Good times.</div>
<div>
<br/>I also found a few cool scriptures in my reading in el Libro de Mormon. I really like what Alma 26:22 says. This is it: "Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good works, and prayeth continually without ceasing—unto such it is given to know the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things which never have been revealed; yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring thousands of souls to repentance, even as it has been given unto us to bring these our brethren to repentance." This tells us the blessings of repenting and having faith and a few other things. For me as a missionary it is important that I do those things, so that I can bring thousands of soulds to repentance! I love this verse! Another verse I like is in Alma 29:9. It says: "I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy." These are the words of Alma. I really like that one too, because Alma isn't glorying in himself, but in the Lord. And his joy is found in bringing souls unto repentence. I want to be like Alma!</div>
<div>
<br/>So thats all I got this week! I hope you are all doing well and having fun with all the Christmas festivities! We are working hard and helping people everyday! I love you all and wish you all a very happy week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

<div>
<br/></div>
Hi family!<br/><br/><div>
Its already December! I still can't believe that 2017 is almost over. Crazy. This week I was fighting a cold. It was sucky, but I'm almost over it now. I just have that lingering cough... But things are good. We are workin hard and helping people everyday!</div>
<div>
<br/>Well as far as the work is going, its going for sure! We are still working with Shaidy, but we have to postpone here baptism because she still hasn't been able to come to church. We went with her on Saturday and she told us she was going for sure, and then she didn't come. We still don't know why, so we will check that out this week. We are working with Dina so she can get baptised this month too. She has been to church a few times, and she is great! We are going to start working harder with Duglas this week. He has been to church twice, and he likes it. So little things are happening, but by small and simple things are great things brought to pass!</div>
<div>
<br/>This week I started reading about the missionary work of the Sons of Mosiah. I love it! Something really stuck out to me in chapter 17. Alma 17:28-32 has something very important to all of us. It says; "28 Now the servants of the king began to murmur, saying: Now the king will slay us, as he has our brethren because their flocks were scattered by the wickedness of these men. And they began to weep exceedingly, saying: Behold, our flocks are scattered already.</div>
<div>
<br/>29 Now they wept because of the fear of being slain. Now when Ammon saw this his heart was swollen within him with joy; for, said he, I will show forth my power unto these my fellow-servants, or the power which is in me, in restoring these flocks unto the king, that I may win the hearts of these my fellow-servants, that I may lead them to believe in my words.<br/>30 And now, these were the thoughts of Ammon, when he saw the afflictions of those whom he termed to be his brethren.</div>
<div>
<br/>31 And it came to pass that he flattered them by his words, saying: My brethren, be of good cheer and let us go in search of the flocks, and we will gather them together and bring them back unto the place of water; and thus we will preserve the flocks unto the king and he will not slay us.</div>
<div>
<br/>32 And it came to pass that they went in search of the flocks, and they did follow Ammon, and they rushed forth with much swiftness and did head the flocks of the king, and did gather them together again to the place of water." So what happened is that Ammons companion shepherds immediately began to murmur after their flocks were scattered. Ammon was different. He knew it was his chance to win the hearts of the Lamanites he was with. So Ammon began right then and there to work. He didn't wait, he told the others what to do and they all worked with swiftness until the flocks were gathered again. This is something that Dad has always taught me. We shouldn't wait around for others to do or start something. We should take that step. That is something I've seen here. There are missionaries who wait around for stuff to happen or for people to tell them what to do. I don't like being that type of missionary. I can't stand just waiting around for stuff to happen. So yeah, thats what I learned this week :)</div>
<div>
<br/>We were also able to go to the First Presidency Devotional yesterday, and it was great! I loved President Uchtdorf's talk. My favorite quote was this, "Its not how much you have, but how much you love." I love it! Its so true. We should focus on love this holiday season, not in temporal things. <br/>Well thats all I got! I hope you are all doing well and loving life! I hope you are all enjoying the snow and the cold! I love you all and I hope you have a holly jolly week! :D</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

Its been another great week everyone! I am loving life and we are doing our best to be our best! A lot of things happened this week, so I will give a lil rundown of everything.<br/></div>
<div>
On Tuesday we were able to watch the First Presidency broadcast. It was really great to hear from Presidents Nelson, Oaks, and Eyring. It is interesting to see how the Lord puts men in leadership roles to fulfill his purposes. So it was interesting to see that they called President Oaks into the First Presidency. But it is always reassuring to know that the Lord guides His church!<br/></div>
<div>
Wednesday we did visits with our branch mission leader, Nelson. He is awesome! Anyways, we were walking and contacting and there was a super awesome sunset and I was able to get some great pics! Good times.<br/></div>
<div>
Thursday we did divisions in Santa Barbara. I went with Elder Smith and Elder Godoy went with Elder Acevedo. All four of us went to an aldea, village, and contacted. It went really well and it was really fun. It was rainy and muddy and it was great! Plus we saw a quetzal!!!!!!!! It was awesome to see one in person, and I got some amazing pics!!! It was awesome! haha There was a river we had  to cross and I was taking a picture of the river, and my footslipped and my leg got soaked  up to the knee!! haha But we were already wet from the rain, so it wasn't a big deal, but it was freezing cold! Santa Barbara is colder than Salamá.<br/></div>
<div>
Saturday was Silvia's baptism! Everything went really well, and her husband, Kevin, baptized her. It was really special. Its always amazing to watch someone accept the gospel and get baptized! So Saturday was a happy day.<br/></div>
<div>
And today we met up with some missionaries and some people from the branch and we went on a hike! We went to the top of one of the mountains here, and we could see the entire valley! It was awesome! I obviously got a ton of pics. I took a bunch of panos too! <br/></div>
<div>
So I have a bunch of pics to send today, and I hope you all enjoy them! I have been reading in Helaman this week and I am almost done! What I have noticed is that we should be more like Nephi (son of Helaman). I really liked Helaman 10:5. These are the words of the Lord to Nephi: "And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will." Nephi was so faithful to the  Lord that he was given the sealing power, and he received the power that anything he asked the Lord would be fulfilled. He was so faithful that the Lord knew that Nephi wouldn't ask for anything contrary to His will. We should learn to be more like Nephi! <br/></div>
<div>
I am happy and healthy. We are working hard. This week is going to be another fun filled week. A Seventy, Elder Zeballos, is coming to the mission this week. We are going to have a MultiZone Conference with him on Wednesday, and we are having our leaders meeting with him on Saturday, but we are having the meeting in Chulak. Chulak is in the mountains of a really  awesome part of the mission! Plus this week the change ends, so we will have changes. So a lot is going to happen this week... haha But I am happy that  you are all happy! :D I love you all a ton, and I hope you all have  a superb week!<br/></div>
<div>
Love  ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>Many Things</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-942549061609139496" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello everyone! <br/><br/><div>
Well here we are, another week in the past! Time is flying so fast! I can't believe it! haha This week has been full of lots of stuff! But to start, on Wednesday afternoon we found out about President Monson's passing. It was sad to hear the news, but I know that he is now resting. I am so grateful for everything that President Monson did. I have learned so much from his many teachings, and he is such an amazing example for all of us. I know for a fact that he was a prophet of God. I have no doubt in my mind that he was God's chosen servant to lead His church. What a blessing it is that the organization of the church is so that we will always have a prophet. We truely are blessed. We are blessed because of President Monson's life and legacy, and also becuase another prophet will be called to lead and guide us.<br/></div>
<div>
Another little thing that happened is that the other night there was a little earthquake! It was really small, and nothing happened. But I was sleeping and I woke up and my bed was shaking. I looked over to my comp's bed because I guess I thought he was shaking my bed. But he was asleep, so it was an earthquake, and I went back to sleep. haha <br/></div>
<div>
In my studies this week in the Libro de Mormón, I am still in the war chapters. So its all war stuff... But I was reading somewhere else about the importance of the scriptures and I found a couple of cool verses in the Bible. I really like what is said in John 20:31. It reads, "But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name." So the scriptures are written so that we may believe in Christ. And when we believe in Him, we can have eternal life! Cool little scripture! And the footnote A of that scriptrue takes us to 1 John 5:13, which I also liked. It says, "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life..." This scripture basically says the same thing, but a little different. So the scriptures are written for us that me may believe in the Son of God, and so we can know we have eternal life on his name. So yeah, thats what I got from my studies this week.<br/></div>
<div>
We are working hard and helping people come unto Christ. I love you all so much! I hope you all have a magnificent week!<br/></div>
<div>
Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>Feliz Año Nuevo!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-8731390594680161654" itemprop="description articleBody">
Feliz Año Nuevo a todos!!!<br/><br/><div>
I still can't believe that it is already 2018! It really seems like it was 2015 yesterday. haha But this week went well. Life is good. <br/></div>
<div>
Well the only noteworthy thing that happened is that yesterday we put a fecha with Silvia! She has been an investigator for a while now, and she just got married to her now husband who is a member. It was good because we didn't put the date, she picked it. So it that was basically the last thing I did in 2017! :D We are working with another girl named Yoseline. She works with a member and we are trying to put a fecha with her. Sorry there isn't much info... But thats kinda the investigator scene for us right now.<br/></div>
<div>
Lately in my Libro de Mormón reading I've been in the war chapters of Alma, so its really just war tactics and strategies. Its cool. Basically what I've learned is that we need to be like Moroni. He was a great leader and prepared the Nephites spiritually and he prepared their cities to be super strong. The Lamanites were fueled by anger, and the Nephites were fueled by liberty. <br/></div>
<div>
Sorry theres not much to share today, I just really have nothing to say... haha We are in Cobán today because we had our leaders meeting, and it was awesome! Like always, Presidente teaches us exactly what we need to hear! I learned so much! :D Well I love you all, and I wish you all a very happy and successful year, and a very happy week!<br/></div>
<div>

</div><h1>District Conference</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-2944329346646985664" itemprop="description articleBody">
¡Hola!<div>
<br/>Hi everyone! I hope you are all doing well! I hope you are all happy! :D I am happy and I'm doing well. This week was a hard week. The truth is that is was the worst week I've had in a while. Not a lot of people wanted to listen to us. Not a lot of people were home. But on the bright side, one of our investigators we've had for a while is now progressing! And we had District Conference yesterday, and it was great! So even though it was a rough week, there are always good things that happen. Oh I also found some cookies that taste excactly like Thin Mints! So that was another good thing that happened this week. haha</div>
<div>
<br/>District Conference was great. Presidente Faúndez came and spoke. I got to listen to him speak twice! I love learning from Presidente. He knows so much, and he is a skilled speaker. There was something that he said that I liked a lot. He was talking about the progress of the District. Here is a little backstory. The District Salamá has been a District for about 40 years. So the question is 'why isn't the District a Stake yet'? So speaking of that Presidente said, "A profound change starts with a personal change." I liked it because that is excactly what the District needs. Everyone wants so much to grow to be a Stake, but everyone wants the big change so much that they overlook the little change. I think that is something that all of us need. I'm sure we'd all like the world to be a little nicer, a little more peaceful and pleasant, and a little more safe. But to change the world, we need to first make changes in ourselves. And who can help us make the change? Jesus Christ! He knows what to do to help us personally change and be better people. He is willing to help us, we just need to let Him do so. Another thing that I liked that I heard in the conference was a scripture. It is in Acts 14:22. It says, "Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God." I liked it, but it was a little easier to understand in Spanish... haha But it was cool. I still haven't had time to study it out. So yeah, thats what I learned from the District Conference!</div>
<div>
<br/>Another cool thing that happend was that last Monday night we had a noche de hogar with some members. They invited two investigators who are deaf and mute. We had a super cool lesson teaching them with pictures and signs! I was able to help out a lot, and it made me feel good :) Luckily one of the investigators knows how to read and write, so we were able to communicate like that too. It was fun!</div>
<div>
<br/>So like I said, I am doing well and we are working hard! Today we got to play basketball and it was amazing! :D haha I love you all so much! I hope you all have a fantastic week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

¡Hola!<br/><br/><div>
Well its been another great week! The only thing is that I don't have anything so say... I have been staring at this email for a few minutes now and I've got nothin...  We worked hard, like always. We taught a lot of people, and found a couple new people to teach. We helped with different meetings and such. My studies are going well. Life is good. That's really it. haha<br/></div>
<div>
I will talk about the people we are teaching. We are working with Alisia, who is the sister of a member family. We are helping her find a deeper testimony. Jenifer is the wife of a member. We are working on teaching her to prepare her for her baptism. Luis we met this week and he seems promising. We had a lesson with Hilka and her brother Jose. We met them a while ago, but we had a lesson with them this week sand they are showing more interest! They ask a lot of questions! So that is our teaching pool right now.<br/></div>
<div>
I am reading in 3 Nephi right now. I am in the middle of Christ's visit to the Nephites! When I read 3 Nephi 11 I felt the Spirit so strong! It was awesome! I know that the Book of Mormon is true. I know that it testifies of Christ. I really liked what it says in 3 Nephi 11:32. It says, "And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me." It is a simple scripture that teaches us the purpose and mission of the Godhead. I liked it. :D <br/></div>
<div>
Well like I said, I don't have much to say today. Hopefully I will find more to say next week! I am happy and doing well here in Salamá! I love you all and I hope you have an excellent week!<br/></div>

Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

Hola!!!<br/><br/><div>
This week passed by so fast!! It was a busy week, so thats why. haha On Wednesday we had a multi-zone conference with Elder Zeballos, and on Saturday we had our leaders meeing with Elder Zeballos, but in Chulak! So I will get into the details now. :D</div>
<div>
<br/>So like I said, on Wednesday we had our multi-zone conference. Our zone (Baja Verapaz) was there with zones Alta Verapaz and Cobán. Presidente and Hermana Faúndez spoke, along with Hermana Zeballos. And they were all great! But Elder Zeballos taught so well! The Spirit was SO strong! It was a feeling of love and peace, and it was amazing :) There were many things that were shared that helped us as missionaries, and me personally as well. The overall theme was the importance of preaching with the Holy Ghost. It helped so much! Elder Zeballos likes looking up the difinitions and origins of words. He talked about the Spanish word 'ánimo.' It comes from the Latin word, 'animus,' which means spirit or soul. He warned us of the word 'desanimo' which means discouragement. Because 'desanimo' basically means 'without spirit' or 'without soul.' So we don't want to teach without the Spirit, so we need to do what is necesary that He is there with us! Antother thing that he shared with us that I liked a lot is a quote from C.S. Lewis. He said, "It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses… There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal." What a powerful thought!!! If we see everyone with this perspective we can see people like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ see them. I love it!</div>
<div>
<br/>Saturday we had the chance to go to Chulak. Chulak is in a part of the mission called the Polochik, where the people only speak Q'eqchi'. And Chulak is in the mountains!!! :D So we went there with the other zone leaders and hermana leaders from Cobán. We rented a bus to take us. We got there in the morning and we  had our meeting in the afternoon. Elder Nielsen was there and it was great to talk to him again! He is a good friend of mine. But the cool thing is that Elder Nielsen started the mission in Chulak, so he knows the area. We got permission from Presidente to go and visit some member families! A few of us went up, and we visited two families. And it was cool to see that I know more Q'eqchi' than I've given myself credit for! :D It was fun to practice and use what  I know. So our leaders meeting with Elder Zeballos was great! He took the whole time and helped us understand the role of being a leader, and what we can do to increase the quality of the work here in the mission. He picked apart another word for us that I liked a lot. He told us about the word 'sacrificio,' or sacrifice. The word comes from two Latin words: 'sacer' and 'facere'. 'Sacer' means 'sagrado' or sacred, and 'facere' means 'hacer' or to do. So 'sacrificio' can mean 'hacer algo sagrado' or do something sacred. The word sacrifice will always have a different meaning for me! </div>
<div>
<br/>So the work is going well here. Me and Elder Godoy are staying together another change! We are working with a few people right now so they can have a fecha. So all is well. I have a pretty gnarly cough, so thats fun to work around... haha But other than that I am doing great! :D haha I love you all and  I hope you all have a fantastic week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

Hola!<br/><br/><div>
What a week!! haha On Tuesday I met my companion! His name is Elder Estay! He is from Chile! We got to Tactic on Wednesday morning. There is only one area in Tactic this time around instead of two. So I'm not living in the same house I lived in before. The house was a disaster!! Ah! But we tackled it and now we have a clean and organized house! Lucky for me Elder Estay also shares the importance of living clean so we both worked at it. It is so great being in a clean and organized house! haha <br/></div>
<div>
We have been working really hard this week! We have been contacting a lot, because the last companionship didn't have a lot of investigators. But we have been spending a lot of time in the area that I already know. We still need to get to know the other side. But something that is really cool is that I've been blessed to remember the houses of a lot of people! There are a few houses that I only visited once and I found them!! So right now we are more in the finding stage of things. But being in Tactic again is awesome! It is so beautiful here! The weather is good, not too hot, not too cold. The mountains are awesome and the people are awesome too! :D<br/></div>
<div>
Something that I read in my personal studies this week is in 2 Nephi 4. Verse 15 says, "And upon these I write the things of my soul, and many of the scriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass. For my soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children." I like this because it is the purpose of the scriptures! Verses 30, and 34-35 are really great! "30 Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the Lord, and say: O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God, and the rock of my salvation. 34 O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. … 35 Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen." We need to put our trust in the Lord always! I liked these verses and they helped me this week.<br/></div>
<div>
Life is good! I am happy and healthy and we are working hard! I hope everyone enjoyed their St. Patrick's day! I know that Amanda did ;) haha And happy birthday to Trevor! #16 I love you all and I hope you all have a wonderful week!<br/></div>

</div><h1>I'm going back to Tactic!!!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-5778601640212060059" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hola!<div>
<br/>Well the news of the week is that I have a change! I am going back to Tactic! I am going to train a new missionary, so right now I don't know who my comp will be. But I am so happy! I am so excited to go back to Tactic and serve with the people there. Its also fun, because this time around I know Spanish! hahaha But the sad thing about all this, is that I've had to say goodbye to the people I've come to love here in Salamá. </div>
<div>
<br/>Something that I liked from my scripture study this week is in 1 Nephi 18:2. It says, "Now I, Nephi, did not work the timbers after the manner which was learned by men, neither did I build the ship after the manner of men; but I did build it after the manner which the Lord had shown unto me; wherefore, it was not after the manner of men." Nephi built the ship according to the Lord's instructions, according to the Lord's way. We need to do things according to the Lord's way. When we do things the Lord's way everything works out. It is when we try to do things our way that it doesn't work out the best it can. This is very important in missionary work. Even though I am serving a mission, I am still an intrument in the Lord's hands. This is His work, not mine, not Pte. Faúndez' work, not even President Nelson's work. This is the Lord's work, so we need to do it His way.</div>
<div>
<br/>Sorry I don't have anything else to share this week. I hope you are all doing well. I love you all so much! I can't believe that this week I am starting my last 12 weeks! It seems like yesterday that I was starting the mission! Keep up the good work everyone and be happy! Have a fantastic week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

Hola everyone!<br/>
<div>
<br/>
Its been a crazy week! We had our leaders meeting last Monday, we had a multi-zone conference on Friday with divisions that night! Not to mention the two district meetings we had! So we've been pretty busy! haha In our leaders meeting and the multi-zone conference I learned a lot. I learned what I need to do to be a better missionary, and what I need to do to be a better leader to help the zone. Good stuff!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Today we went with Elder Smith and Elder Acevedo to a waterfall in their area (Santa Barbara)! We went with two boys from the Santa Barbara Group, and they showed us the way. It was awesome!!! The hike was fun, but it was hard! haha I haven't hiked switch-backs in a long time! Plus it was hot. But I brought water, so I was good. And I lot a lot of cool pics, so it was awesome!</div>
<div>
<br/>
So this week we have been focused on our best investigator, Hilka. I think I've already talked about her. She is awesome! She understands everything we teach, and if not, she asks questions. She is reading the Book of Mormon and is praying! Yesterday she came to church for the 3rd time. So on Tuesday we had a lesson with here and put a fecha with her to get baptized the 10th of March! She accepted! On Friday I went with her with Elder Lopez (divisions). We talked with her and her mom. Hilka is 16, so she needs permission from her mom. Hilka had talked with her mom beforehand, and she said no. We talked with her mom for about an hour and did everything except for fight with her, and she still said no... It was sad. For fast Sunday we fasted as a zone for the zone. So we knew that would help! We talked with one of Pte. Faúndez' couselors, Pte. Vela, and he visited Hilka with us. We were able to talk to her mom again, and Pte. Vela talked with her. She still said no... We have basically done all we can. We have prayed for her, fasted, and even invited Pte. Vela, but still no... When we left Hilka handed us a note. When we got back to the house, Elder Godoy read the note. Hilka told us in the note that she knows that her mom is firm in her descision. But she told us that she has felt the Spirit in her heart, and she knows that being baptized is what she needs to do. She told us that she will keep doing everything she can so that she can get baptized when she turns 18. The note helped us realize that what is happening with Hilka is the Lord's will. He knows what is best for her, and he has a plan for her. Elder Godoy and I felt better after reading the note, and we both were able to feel hope. It was a special experience.</div>
<div>
<br/>
I liked a scripture from my reading this week. 1 Nephi 9:6 says, "But the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men; for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words. And thus it is. Amen." The Lord knows all things. He knows what we need in our lives. He has His plan. Something small, but that can help us.</div>
<div>
<br/>
I am doing well and I am healthy! We are working hard here in Salamá! I am grateful to be here serving the Lord. I hope that you are all doing well too! I love you all and I hope you have a fantastic week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>
Elder Kelley<br/>

<br/>
Hey everyone!<br/>
<div>
<br/>
This week went well. We had some really great lessons with our investigator Hilka, and her brother Jose. One of the lessons their mom sat in too, to that was great! We found a family that shows a lot of potential. They don't go to a church and they ask a lot of questions! We are going to help them this week so they can progress. So that is a small summary of the work this week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
This week I read a bunch and I finished reading el Libro de Mormón! I'm glad that I was able to finish. And I'm sure you can remember that I was reading and highlighting everything that had to do with the Atonement of Jesus Christ. It was really cool to learn more about the Atonement by focusing on it while reading the Book of Mormon. I want to point out the last thing I highlighted. The last thing I hightlighted is in Moroni 10:33, "without spot." I was thinking about it, and what a simple, yet powerful way to sum up the Atonement. Thanks to the Atonement of Jesus Christ we can become clean "without spot." I feel like that is one of the essential purposes of the Atonement, so that we can become clean from sin. What a blessing it is that, thanks to Jesus Christ and His Atonement, we can repent, and become clean! I know with all my heart that the Book of Mormon is true! I know that it testifies of Christ and teaches us of His Atonement! </div>
<div>
<br/>
I also want to share a few scriptures I found this week. One is in Moroni 7:13. It says, "But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually; wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God, and to serve him, is inspired of God." This has to do with the scripture I shared last week. It is simple. Anything that persuades us to do good comes from God. Easy. We know when things come from God if they are good, and if not, well we shouldn't to it! haha The other scripture that I liked from my study is in Doctrine and Covenants 88:67. "And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things." Here are some of the blessings of focusing our lives on the Lord, or that our eyes be single to His glory. If we focus on the Lord better and more often in our lives, we will be filled with light! There will be no darkness in us. And the best part is that when we are filled with light, we can comprehend all things! Thats awesome! We need to focus ourselves more on living the gospel of Jesus Christ so that we can be filled with light to the point that we can comprehend all things. </div>
<div>
<br/>
I hope you are all enjoying the cold and snowy weather! I am enjoying the sun and the heat! We have been in the high 80's and low 90's all week! It is so hot! haha So I know there are some of you that want to be where I am, but remember to enjoy the cold and snow while you can! :D haha I love you all and I wish you all a happy week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

Hi!<br/>
<div>
<br/>
I hope everyone is doing well this week! We had a better week than we did last week, whad did I say right? haha It wasn't the best week I've had, but it was better than last week. We met some new people and had a bunch a great lessons! Plus I gave a talk yesterday, and also taught the Gospel Principles class. So all four of us missionaries in our branch and our branch mission leader spoke yesterday about the importance of members helping in missionary work. It was great! And my class was about the Creation. I did a classic Brian Kelley spreadsheet, and everyone seemed to learn something, so that was good. haha </div>
<div>
<br/>
Among other things, I have been reading a lot in the Libro de Mormón, like always. I started Ether this week. So I found two scriptures that I really liked. One is in Mormon 9:27 and it says, " O then despise not, and wonder not, but hearken unto the words of the Lord, and ask the Father in the name of Jesus for what things soever ye shall stand in need. Doubt not, but be believing, and begin as in times of old, and come unto the Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear and trembling before him. (emphasis added)" I liked it a lot for what I emphasised. We should counsel the Lord in whatsover things that we stand in need of, and be believing. I liked it. The other scripture that I liked is in Ether 4:11-12. "But he that believeth these things which I have spoken, him will I visit with the manifestations of my Spirit, and he shall know and bear record. For because of my Spirit he shall know that these things are true; for it persuadeth men to do good. And whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do good is of me; for good cometh of none save it be of me. I am the same that leadeth men to all good; he that will not believe my words will not believe me—that I am; and he that will not believe me will not believe the Father who sent me. For behold, I am the Father, I am the light, and the life, and the truth of the world." Anything that persuades, or tells, us to do good comes from God. Simple as that. God is good. I invite you to study those scriptures on your own to learn for yourselves! </div>
<div>
<br/>
Well thats all I got. I am doing well. We are working hard and enjoying the heat here in Salamá! I love you all and wish you all a fantastic week!</div>

Hello everyone!<br/><br/><div>
We had a good week this week. Yesterday was my golden cumplemes! I reached 22 months on the mission on the 22nd of the month. haha We met two boys named Juan and Marcos. A member family is helping them out because they are 15 and 12 and are living alone... So we've taught them and they are really receptive and we invited them to get baptized and they said yes! We are hoping to help them get baptized in May. So thats the biggest news of the week.</div>
<div>
<br/>I found a bunch of cool scriptures this week in my various studies. Here are a few of them. Alma 5:38-39 says, "Behold, I say unto you, that the good shepherd doth call you; yea, and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of Christ; and if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd, to the name by which ye are called, behold, ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd. And now if ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what fold are ye? Behold, I say unto you, that the devil is your shepherd, and ye are of his fold; and now, who can deny this? Behold, I say unto you, whosoever denieth this is a liar and a child of the devil." We need to follow Christ, and He calls us in our own name! Cool! And if we aren't the sheep of the Good Shepherd, well we have to be some other pastor's sheep. I also liked Alma 5:45-48 and I want you all to read it. It is a bit long so I won't include it. It is how Alma obtained his testimony. Its cool. I found a scripture in 1 Peter 4:9-10 that talks about ministering, "Use hospitality one to another without grudging. As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God." I liked it and I thought it would help us all understand a little more what ministering is. In 1 Corinthians 14:33 it says, "For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints." God is the author of peace, not confusion. Simple as that. I was feeling a little down Sunday morning, and I was flipping through my English scriptures, which I don't use that often. I was in Moroni and was directed by my own notes to a scripture that I had never really paid attention to before. Moroni 9:25 was excatly what I needed to hear in that moment. It says, "My son, be faithful in Christ; and may not the things which I have written grieve thee, to weigh thee down unto death; but may Christ lift thee up, and may his sufferings and death, and the showing his body unto our fathers, and his mercy and long-suffering, and the hope of his glory and of eternal life, rest in your mind forever." We need to be faithful in Christ and let him lift us up. We need to continually be thinking about what He did for us.</div>
<div>
<br/>Among other things, its been pretty cold this week, and pretty hot! The climate here is crazy! Our shower head heater stopped working so we've been heating water on the stove and bucket showering. All part of the experience. I actually like it a lot! haha And today I went to the doctor to get one of my toenails removed... My left index toe had some fungus and the easiest, fastest, and best way to fix it was to remove the nail. So we'll se how that goes this week. haha</div>
<div>
<br/>We are working hard and helping people everyday. I am doing well. I love you all and I hope you all have a fantastic week!</div>

Hola everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
This week was a little rainier than normal so it was a lil chilly, which was great! We did divisions this week and Elder Hugentobler and I were in an aldea (village) and stumbled on a super big cave! It was awesome! We played soccer this morning with a bunch of missionaries and I had a blast! There is a missionary we played with (on my team) and he is going to try out for Real Salt Lake after the mission, so he is pretty good. haha</div>
<div>
<br/>
Among other things... Fredy is out of town working and told us this week that he won't get back until May... We are teaching Alan and he knows he needs to get baptized, but he won't come to church! So we are working on those two lil problems for now. And we are meeting a ton of people and we have a bunch of people that are interested, so we are working with them too.</div>
<div>
<br/>
Lately I have been liking to listen to conference talks. I downloaded a bunch last week and today and I listened to them. I really loved Elder Bendar's talk from this last conference. He talked about meekness and it was awesome! I studied afterwards about meekness. Elder Bednar explains that the difference between humility and meekness is that meekness has to do with spiritual receptivity to the Hold Ghost and to people who may seem lesser qualified to give suggestions. It was cool. I also liked a few verses from my study of the Book of Mormon. In Mosiah 7:33 it says, "But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage." Turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart. We need to trust the Lord, serve the Lord, and turn to Him! </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Mosiah 14:4-5 says, "Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed." This one is always good to help us realize what Jesus did for us. Mosiah 18:21 reads, "And he commanded them that there should be no contention one with another, but that they should look forward with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another." The power of unity! I think this has to do with the recent changes in the Church. We need to be more united and love eachother more. Simple. </div>
<div>
<br/>
Thats all I got this week! I hope you are all doing well and enjoying life! I am doing well and I am happy. Sure there are bad days, but there were actually a bunch of good and a few great days this week! :D haha I love you all and I hope you all have an excellent week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>
Elder Kelley<br/>

</div><h1>Week #?</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-6522100802936752397" itemprop="description articleBody">
April 9, 2018<br/><br/>¡Hola!<br/>Well this week went well! We were able to have a good lesson with Fredy and he told us that he received an answer to his prayers and wants to get baptized! We put a fecha with him for the 28th of April! He is going to be gone for 2 weeks working, so we will work with him when he gets back! We are working with a few other people and lots of new and future investigators too.<div>
<br/>I started reading in Mosiah this week. I particularly liked a few verses in chapter 5. Mosiah 5:8-10 says, "And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free. There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives. And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God, for he shall know the name by which he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ. And now it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall not take upon him the name of Christ must be called by some other name; therefore, he findeth himself on the left hand of God." We need to take upon ourselves the name of Christ to be counted among His people. I also liked verse 13, "For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?" Serving the Lord helps us come to know Him better. This verse was like dang, if we don't serve Him and His people we are strangers unto Him! Something to think about. </div>
<div>
<br/>I also liked a quote from Elder Uchtdorf. He said, "Out of pure love He gave all that we might receive all." I liked this a lot. I did a drawing of it too! :D </div>
<div>
<br/>Well I love you all! Life is good and we are working hard! I hope you have a wonderful week!<br/></div>

Hola!!<br/>
<div>
<br/>
Life is good! The Church is true! Conference was amazing!!! I learned so much and felt the Spirit so strong! We went to Cobán to watch the conference, and I was able to watch each session in English!! To start off, it was a special and spiritual experience to be able to stand with the entire membership of the church to sustain President Russell M. Nelson as the 17th President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. What a blessing it is to be guided by him in our day. And it is so cool that Elders Gong and Soares were called to the Quorum of the Twelve! The truth is that I loved each and every talk. Of course I learned more from others and all, but it was all great! The talks in particular that I liked or helped me personally were given by: President Ballard, Larry Echo Hawk, Taniela B. Wakolo, Devin G. Durrant, Elder Christofferson, President Nelson (Sunday Morning), Elder Holland, and Elder Uchtdorf. I know thats a lot, but I can't decide! haha But I really loved Elder Uchtdorf's talk. But I think the most spiritual part of the conference for me was the end of the Priesthood Session. To close his talk, President Nelson asked all to stand by quorum, starting with Deacons ending with Apostles, and to stay standing to sing the closing hymn. We sang hymn 324 Rise Up, O Men of God. I was watching in the office with 4 other Elders. We stood and sang with the congregation. The 5 of us were alone, no one else. We stood and sang and a simple feeling of peace and unity came upon me. Something as simple as following the Prophet, standing and singing, was still an act of obedience. We stood and sang and it was a special experience for me. I will have to study the talks even more to continue learning!</div>
<div>
<br/>
I also learned some stuff from my studies this week. I liked 2 Nephi 31:21. It says, "And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen." There is no other way to be saved other than by Jesus Christ. Only by and through Him. And this is the only true doctrine of Christ, no other doctrine is correct. The Gospel of Jesus Christ gives us a guide so we know what we need to do in order to return to the presence of our Heavenly Father. I also liked 2 Nephi 33:6. It says, "I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul from hell." I too glory in these things, especially in Jesus who will redeem my sould from hell according to my obedience, righteousness, and repentance. <br/>
We are working with Fredy to set up a baptismal date for him in April. He is working hard and he came to both days of conference! I know he is ready!</div>
<div>
<br/>
I am happy and doing well! I love you all and I hope you are equally happy! :D I hope you all have a wonderful week!</div>

Love ya!<br/>

March 26, 2018<br/>
<br/>
Hi everyone!<br/>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
We had another great week! There were lots of little things that helped me see the Lords hand in this His work. We met a lot of people who are showing interest, and we are helping all of them progress towards Christ! </div>
<div>
<br/>
So this week we went with a lot of the people we contacted last week. Obviously some people accepted more lessons, and some no. But we have found a lot of people who don't go to any church, which is rare here. And we have talked with a lot of members and met a few of their friends. Our most important investigator right now is Fredy. He is a friend of a member who was less-active until Fredy (the non-member) invited him! So Fredy has been to church 3 or 4 times already, and we had our first lesson with him yesterday. He has recognized the Spirit that he has felt at church, and we helped him understand that he can feel like that always after he has the gift of the Holy Ghost. So we talked to him and invited him to get baptized and he is pondering about it and praying about it now. So hopefully we can help him get baptized in April! So we have lots of people to visit!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Some of the little things that helped us this week were these. First off on Tuesday we were contacting a bit and walking to another visit, and we passed a house, and I don't know if I heard it or if I said it to myself, but what I heard or thought was, "lets contact that house." I stopped on a dime as soon as the thought came. We contacted the house and talked with a man who doesn't go to any chuch and he shows lots of interest. It was cool how I was propted by the Spirit to contact that house. Another thing is that on Thursday we went to Tamahu. We went in the early afternoon and wanted to visit a lot of members and an investigator that we knew all have jobs. So we went, and every single on of them was home! It is crazy, because a week day afternoon none of them were at work! So we talked with them so now we have an idea of how we want to work in Tamahu! Little things :)</div>
<div>
<br/>
Now for what I learned in my studies. I studied this week about what it means to have a broken heart and a contrite spirit, because I didn't know what it meant. I learned that a broken heart can mean to be humble, and contrite means repentant. So to have a broken heart and a contrite spirit means to be humble and repentant, and to follow the Lord's will now matter what it be. I studied more of one of the scriptures I found and I will send the pic of my lil study notes on it! I also studied the meaning of being pure in heart. So pure means to be free from sin or guilt. So having a pure heart means that we have a heart free from sin. if the heart is pure, the whole body is pure. I liked Jacob 3:2. It says. "O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive the pleasing word of God, and feast upon his love; for ye may, if your minds are firm, forever." Cool. Another scripture that I read is in 2 Nefi 9:21-22. It says. "And he cometh into the world that he may save all men if they will hearken unto his voice; for behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam. And he suffereth this that the resurrection might pass upon all men, that all might stand before him at the great and judgment day." It was cool reading this and connecting the Atonement to the Resurrection. Christ suffered all of what He suffered to that all may be Resurrected and so that all might stand before Him to be judged. I liked the connection. </div>
<div>
<br/>
Life is good. We are working hard and are working together. I am happy and I drew a lot this week! I hope you are all doing well and I hope you all have an excellent week!</div>
<div>
Love ya!<br/>
Elder Kelley<br/>

</div><h1>#Blessed</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-314875359230541124" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hola!!!<div>
<br/>Well we had a baptism on Saturday! We had been working with an 8-year-old, Aldair, for the last few weeks. His family is all members, but his dad's records are missing. We confirmed with Pte. Barrios this week and the records are lost... So that meant that the baptism was our responsability. So that went well. Elder Estay baptized Aldair, and I confirmed him. It was fun :) This week we have planned Elvira's baptism, and maybe even Alan will get baptized this week too! And we are working more with Ivan, and Fredy finally came back from work!!! So we have two baptisms planned, and two on the way! #Blessed </div>
<div>
<br/>Yesterday I also spoke in church about member missionary work. It went well I think... haha Today, as a zone activity, we went to a super awesome cave! I got some cool pics and stuff. So that was fun too. </div>
<div>
<br/>I read a few BYU Speeches this week and I learned a lot! I also finished Alma in my Book of Mormon reading. Here are a few quotes I liked from the speeches. These are from a talk by Sheri L. Dew called You Were Born to Lead, You Were Born for Glory. "There is only one thing the power of God and the power of Satan have in common: Neither can influence us unless we allow them to. … the kind of power operating in our lives is entirely up to us." This is so true and an interesting way to put it. It is entirely up to us which power is evident in our lives. "A casual understanding of the gospel will not sustain you through the days ahead, which is why it is imperative that you immerse yourself in the word of God." Also very true! Not only do we need to understand more fully the gospel, we need to "immerse" ourselves everyday in the scriptures. "The scriptures are the handbook for the language of revelation. They are our personal Liahona. If you will regularly immerse yourself in the scriptures, you’ll get clearer, more frequent answers to your prayers." I liked this too. To understand the language of revelation we need to study the grammar book: the scriptures! "Those who are endowed with power in the house of the Lord need never face the adversary alone." What a blessing! With the Endowment, we never need to face temptation, suffering, pain - or anything for that matter - alone! I also read a BYU Speech by Elder Holland called Banishing All Shadows. "You have entered to learn. Now go forth to serve and strengthen." We know what to do, so we should do it! We know that we need to serve, help, minister, como sea, so lets do it! :D "This is the Church of the happy endings. Troubles need never be permanent nor fatal. Darkness always yields to light. The sun always rises. Faith, hope, and charity will always triumph in the end. Furthermore, they will triumph all along the way." Darkness always yields to light. The sun always rises. The gospel of Jesus Christ gives us hope (see Ether 12:4)! And here is a quote by C.S. Lewis that I found, "Christ says, ‘Give me All. I don’t want so much of your time and so much of your money and so much of your work: I want You.’" Christ wants us to give our all to Him so He can give His all to us. What a blessing.<br/></div>
<div>
Well I am doing well and working hard. We have lots to do in the next couple of weeks! I know that my time is short, but I am making it count! I love you all and I hope you all have a wonderful week!<br/></div>
<div>
Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>

</div><h1>Happy Mother's Day!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7055344277559376519" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hola everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<div>
First off, happy Mother's Day to all those mothers out there! :D It was awesome talking to you all yesterday and talking with Jacob for the first time! haha Its weird that I will see you all so soon... But there is still a lot of work to do until then!</div>
<div>
<br/>
This week we put fechas with Alan and Elvira!!! Alan is going to get baptized on June 2nd, and Elvira is going to get baptized on May 26th. Elvira told us she is going to get baptized because she felt happiness in her heart. We told her that was the Spirit and she was so happy! We also met Ivan this week. He is a reference from a member. We met with him in the church the other day and we talked about the Restoration with him. He told us that he had been praying for the chance to know the truth. He is in Joseph Smith's shoes. He told us that he was confused by all the different churches and all and he accepted the invitation to get baptized! We are going to meet with him today and hopefully put a fecha with him. And all 3 came to church yesterday! Things are working out and we are seeing success. Pray for us please! We are gonna work hard until the end of my mission!!!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Here in Guatemala Mother's Day is celebrated on May 10th every year. So on the 10th We made a few Mother's Day cards and gave them to the Hermanas that we visited that day. There were two Hermanas in particular that were touched by the act of kindness. It was a blessing to see their faces light up when we handed them the cards. I am not aware that their children did anything for them that day, but it was a blessing to help them feel that love.</div>
<div>
<br/>
I am reading in the war chapters of the Book of Mormon right now, so just lots of war strategies are going down. Moral of the story is that we need to follow the Lord always. But I read a talk by President Monson and found a quote that helped me a lot! This is the quote: "As we perform our duties and exercise our Priesthood, we will find true joy. We will experience the satisfaction of having completed our tasks." In this important time of my mission I need to perform my duties and exercise the Priesthood to be able to have the satisfaction of having completed my task. That is something that I want so bad! I want to be able to feel that confirmation that the Lord is happy with me and what I have done these two years. I liked Matthew 25:21, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord." Joy is the blessing of being a faithful servant and performing our duties. </div>
<div>
<br/>
I am doing well and I am healthy and happy. I am working on not being baggy! haha I love you all and I hope you all have a fantastic week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>
Elder Kelley</div>

Hola!<br/><br/><div>
Well this week didn't turn out like we thought it would... Juan and Marcos basically disappeared, so we haven't been able to teach them, and they didn't come to church yesterday. They live alone in a lil house and their land lord gave them a job and told them he would pay their rent. We think that Juan feels obligated to work for the land lord, and Marcos totally wants to go back and live with Hermana Mary. so we don't know excatly whats doing on, but we think at some point they will return to Hermana Mary's house. So we haven't lost hope, but they won't be getting baptized this week... We talked with Alan and Elvira this week too, and they both want to get baptized but they haven't decided on a date yet... So thats what we're looking at right now. We've also been finding a lot of people, and yesterday we went the entire day with Hermano Caal and he took us to visit with a bunch of his family members who aren't members, so that was great too!</div>
<div>
<br/>I read more in Alma this week. I liked a few verses in particular that lead to a deeper study. I like Alma 34:30-31, "And now, my brethren, I would that, after ye have received so many witnesses, seeing that the holy scriptures testify of these things, ye come forth and bring fruit unto repentance. Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time and the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you." This was perfect for an investigator we have, and also for all of us. I interpreted it as 'today is the day!' Cool stuff. I also liked Alma 36:17, "And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world." In this chapter Alma the Younger is explaining his conversion process. Verse 17 is the most important. He said that while he was in the worst suffering, when he was most filled with pain, he thought of the words of his father, Alma, of the Savior. In verse 18 he says that he cried unto the Lord and in verse 19 he says that as soon as he cried unto the Lord he says that his pain and suffering were replaced by peace and joy! What a cool experience! The same moment that he thought of Jesus and prayed, we was blessed with peace and relieved of his suffering. The same can happen for us! We need to play always, not just when we need help, but what a blessing it is to be able to pray in any moment for help! I also liked Alma 37:44, "For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land." This is a comparison of the word of Christ, or the scriptures, and the Liahona. The Liahona worked according to the faith and diligence of Lehi and his family. The Liahona guided Lehi and his family to the promised land. The scriptures also will guide us to the promised land, and eternal happiness. We need to have the faith and diligence necesary to study and learn everyday.</div>
<div>
<br/>Things are going well and life is good. There are times when life is hard, but thats how life is. I am looking forward to talking to you all on Sunday! I can't believe how fast time flies! I love you all and I hope you all have an excellent week!</div>

Hola!<br/>
<div>
<br/>
No sé como pasó otra semana. En serio el tiempo está volando! jaja Pero estamos trabajando bien y estamos teniendo éxito. This week we put a fecha with Juan and Marcos! They are getting baptized the 12th of May. And Alan and Elvira both told us they want to get baptized, but they are thinking about when. So we are going to talk with them this week about the fecha. And Fredy isn't going to be back from work until mid-May, but when he gets back we are gonna teach him like crazy so he can get baptized too! We are working hard and we have a lot of people who we are helping!</div>
<div>
<br/>
I learned a ton this week in my studies. I really liked Alma 17:2-3. It says, "Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel first appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God. But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God." These verses are just super great and we can learn a ton of things from them! Study them to find the treasures! :D haha I also had a super cool study of Doctrine and Covenants 42:61, which says, "If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things—that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal." Revelation upon revelation, knowlegde upon knowledge. Wow. Who doesn't want that! I know I do! haha All that we need to do is ask!!! There is no harm in asking. 3 Nephi 18:20 teaches us that anything we ask for if it is righteous we will receive! I will send the pics of the scripture webs that I made this week. You can study them too if you want... haha I learned a lot, so I am sure that you will too. </div>
<div>
<br/>
Life is pretty darn good right now! We are working hard and we are seeing the fruits of our labors of the last month and a half. I love you all and I wish you all a very happy and productive week!</div>
<div>
<br/>
Love ya!<br/>

Hi everyone!<br/><br/>Well I have a bunch of mixed feelings. I am going home! I can't believe it, but its here. We had Alan's baptism this Satuday and it was a blessing to be able to baptize him! Sunday was a spiritual day. I bore my testimony, and helped play the piano for the branch choir. This week went really well la verdad. Entonces ya me toca irme de la misión, pero sé que es parte de la vida. <br/><br/>I learned a lot in my studies this week! I am running really short on time today, so I will just leave a list of the scriptures I found this week. Here they are:<br/>-Doctrine and Covenants 6:13<br/>-Ether 4:19<br/>-Doctrine and Covenants 63:47<br/>-Doctrine and Covenants 31:13<br/>-Revelation 2:10<br/>-2 Timothy 4:7<br/><br/>Almost all of them have to do with being faithful until the end. I was able to feel the approval of my work last night, so I know that I have been a good and faithful servant. It was a very special feeling :)<br/><br/>I am so grateful for the chance I've had to serve a mission. I am happy to have been able to be a servant in the hands of the Lord to help save some people. My testimony of the Book of Mormon has grown so much here! I know its true. And because I know the Book of Mormon is true I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet and that Jesus is the Christ.<br/><br/>I love you all so much. I can't wait to see you in a few days! :D haha I won't be able to respond to your emails becuase we don't have time... But I am going to read them and we will talk about it later. haha Thanks for you love, prayers, support, and everything over these last two years! I love you all and see you soon! #XikXikWe<br/><br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley

Hola everyone!<div>
<br/>We had a great week! I can't belive how fast time is moving! So the great news of this week is that Elvira got baptized!!! It was great! On Sunday morning after getting confirmed, she told us that she feels so happy! Ah, she is awesome! We also were able to meet with Fredy again and he put his own fecha for the 9th of June! It was awesome! We are also talking with Ivan and another investigator Maria. We are progressing with them too. And Alan is set to get baptized next Sunday morning before church. Pray for us! :D <div>
<br/>Yesterday in Sunday School we learned about Joshua. I really liked Joshua 1:7, "Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest." After reading this scripture Presidente Barrios (he was teaching) turned and asked me how I should apply this to my life. I told him that I need to keep doing all the things I've been doing here on the mission. And the last part is the best, "that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest." That is something that helped me a lot. I also really liked Helaman 14:30-31, "And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free. He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death; and ye can do good and be restored unto that which is good, or have that which is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and have that which is evil restored unto you." The power to choose!" The big idea is that we basically choose how our lives turn out. Sure the choices of others effect our lives, but ultimately we are the ones to choose how we react. The power to choose. Agency is a very special blessing Heavenly Father has blessed us with.</div>
<div>
<br/>So thats about it for this week. Things are going well and I am happy. I can't believe how fast time has gone. I'm really gonna enjoy this last week as a full-time missionary! I love you all and I hope you all have a fantastic week!</div>
<div>
<br/>Love ya!<br/>Elder Kelley</div>
