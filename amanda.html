The fourth article of faith contains most of the Doctrine of Christ which is that all men everywhere must have faith is Jesus Christ, repent of their sins, be baptized, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and Alma added that we must also endure to the end.<br/>
<br/>
Following the Doctrine of Christ is the only way to be saved in the kingdom of God. It is the foundation of the Church and the central message of its missionaries.<br/>
<br/>
Preach My Gospel defines a missionary’s purpose as being “to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.”<br/>
<br/>
Now I hope you’ve been listening because I’ve just repeated the Doctrine of Christ a few times, but it is taught repeatedly for a reason.<br/>
<br/>
Hyrum Smith said this, “Preach the first principles of the Gospel – preach them over and over again: you will find that day after day new ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you. You can enlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly. You will then be able to make them more plainly understood by those [you] teach.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I had the chance to see my youngest brother Dan be baptized. As I sat quietly, I thought about the investigators I will be teaching and reteaching (like Hyrum Smith said) as they prepare to be baptized. Dan I want you to know I’m proud of your decision to be baptized, because being baptized is the first step we must take to follow Jesus Christ. And I know that when we follow Jesus Christ we are blessed.<br/>
<br/>
In True to the Faith we are taught, “when we experience the blessings of gospel living, we naturally want to share those blessings with others.”<br/>
<br/>
I felt this desire in my life and read D&amp;C 4:3 which says, “Therefore, if you have desires to serve God ye are called to the work;” After thinking it through, talking with my parents, and asking Heavenly Father through prayer and fasting I decided to turn in my mission papers. I know it will be tough and that not everyone I teach will accept the gospel, but I am comforted by the Lord’s promise of the joy that comes into our lives when we share His gospel and help others come unto Him. For he taught, “Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God;<br/>
<br/>
For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him.<br/>
<br/>
And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto him, on conditions of repentance.<br/>
<br/>
And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth!<br/>
<br/>
Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people.<br/>
<br/>
And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!<br/>
<br/>
And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!”<br/>
<br/>
President Monson reminds us, “Right now, today, there are many caught in the current of popular opinion. Others are torn by the tide of turbulent times. Yet others are drawn down and drowned in the whirlpool of sin.<br/>
<br/>
This need not be. We have the doctrines of truth. We have the programs. We have the people. We have the power. Our mission is more than meetings. Our service is to save souls.”<br/>
<br/>
This is my motivation. I want to be in the service of saving souls.<br/>
<br/>
“We best serve our Father in Heaven by righteously influencing others and serving them. The greatest example who ever walked the earth is our Savior, Jesus Christ. His mortal ministry was filled with teaching, serving, and loving others. He sat down with individuals who were judged to be unworthy of His companionship. He loved each of them. He discerned their needs and taught them His gospel. He invites us to follow His perfect example.”<br/>
<br/>
In the October 2012 General Conference President Packer shared a story of a time he was in Samoa to reorganize a stake. He said, “The day we were to return, it was raining. Knowing the plane could not land on the wet field, we drove to the west end of the island, where there was a runway of sorts atop a coral break. We waited until dark, but no plane arrived. Finally, we learned by radio that there was a storm, and the plane could not take off. We radioed back that we would come by boat. None of us realized that a ferocious tropical storm had hit the island, and we were heading straight into it.<br/>
<br/>
We arrived in the harbor where there was one narrow passage we were to go through along the reef. A light on the hill above the beach and a second lower light marked the narrow passage. When a boat was maneuvered so that the two lights were one above the other, the boat would be lined up properly to pass through the dangerous rocks that lined the passage.<br/>
<br/>
But that night there was only one light. Two elders were waiting on the landing to meet us, but the crossing took much longer than usual. After watching for hours for signs of our boat, the elders tired and fell asleep, neglecting to turn on the second light, the lower light. As a result, the passage through the reef was not clear.<br/>
<br/>
The captain maneuvered the boat as best he could toward the one upper light on shore. We could hear the breakers crashing over the reef. When we were close enough to see them with a flashlight, the captain frantically shouted reverse and backed away to try again to locate the passage.<br/>
<br/>
After many attempts, he knew it would be impossible to find the passage without the lower lights. All we could do was try to reach the harbor 40 miles away. We were helpless against the ferocious power of the elements. I do not remember ever being where it was so dark.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know who had been waiting for us at the beach. I refused to let them tell me. But it is true that without that lower light, we all might have been lost.”<br/>
<br/>
Now I want to talk about how the Upper and Lower lights work…there’s an upper light set up on a hill and a lower light down near the shore. When those two lights are aligned that marks the safe passage. I like to think of Christ as the upper light and as members we are the lower lights helping people come unto Him.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing from President Packer, “There is in our hymnbook a very old and seldom-sung hymn that has very special meaning to me.”<br/>
<br/>
The hymn is titled Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy. This song has taken on a greater meaning for me as well as I’ve developed a closer relationship with my Savior and discovered just how much I must rely on Him and my responsibility to help others. The song goes like this…<br/>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Brightly beams our Father’s mercy<br/>
From his lighthouse evermore,<br/>
But to us he gives the keeping<br/>
Of the lights along the shore. </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Dark the night of sin has settled;<br/>
Loud the angry billows roar.<br/>
Eager eyes are watching, longing,<br/>
For the lights along the shore. </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Trim your feeble lamp, my brother;<br/>
Some poor sailor, tempest-tossed,<br/>
Trying now to make the harbor,<br/>
In the darkness may be lost. </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Let the lower lights be burning;<br/>
Send a gleam across the wave.<br/>
Some poor fainting, struggling seaman<br/>
You may rescue, you may save.</blockquote>
As members of the church we all have the opportunity to help others come unto Christ. Jesus Christ is the light and the life of the world. As we fix our gaze on His teachings, we will be guided to the harbor of spiritual safety.<br/>
<br/>
In the most recent General Conference Elder Scott said, “The promise of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the Atonement is to take anyone who comes, anyone who will join, and put them through an experience so that at the end of their life, they can go through the veil having repented of their sins and having been washed clean through the blood of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
That is what Latter-day Saints do around the world. That is the Light we offer to those who are in darkness and have lost their way. Wherever our members and missionaries may go, our message is one of faith and hope in the Savior Jesus Christ.”<br/>

Dear Family and Friends,<br/>
<br/>
Week two in the Wisconsin Rapids area went by pretty quickly! Sister Christiansen and I are always meeting with investigators, less actives, and recent converts so there is never a dull moment! <br/>
<br/>
Tracting in the Humidity:<br/>
Thankfully we have a pretty big teaching pool at the moment so we don't have to do a lot of knocking doors, but when an appointment falls through... tracting it is. We tracted earlier this week when it was super hot and it was so miserable! The humidity makes everything feel sticky and it seems like my hair never dries after I shower! Ha but we had another tracting experience later in the week when it was cooler and that was much more enjoyable. We were able to talk with a few people about the gospel and give them a copy of the Book of Mormon. We are hoping to find a golden investigator because right now our investigators aren't progressing much. They all have law of chastity and/or word of wisdom problems and aren't ready to change. We have a few hopeful contacts though so we will keep working!<br/>
<br/>
Meat and Potatoes:<br/>
The members of the ward are really good about feeding the missionaries. We eat at a member's home about 3-5 times a week. Each meal I've had has been different, but they almost always serve meat and potatoes in some form or another! Ha it's a Wisconsin thing I guess! Oh and they refer to dinner as supper so we have "supper appointments" all the time! One of the members made us a "s'more stuffie" which I can only describe as chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow filled calzone - it was so good!<br/>
<br/>
Bugs, Bars, and Bingo:<br/>
So I guess I should explain the subject line of this email.. ha the mosquitos here are so evil! We had a lesson outside the other night and I was eaten alive! My arms are covered in mosquito bites, but I've been using anti-itch cream so at least they aren't itching anymore! Thankfully mosquitos are the only bugs that I've seen, so hopefully it'll stay that way! The bar and bingo thing happened when Sister Christiansen and I were helping out with bingo at the local rehab center. I was talking with one of the ladies there and she asked if I'd been to the nearby bar. I told her I hadn't and she was glad and proceeded to advise me not to go sneaking into a bar because I was much to young for that kind of nonsense. Ha I promised her I wouldn't sneak into any of the local bars anytime soon(:<br/>
<br/>
Hope Anchors the Souls of Man: <br/>
This week we taught a really cool lesson to a less active member about hope. We shared Ether 12:4 which talks about how faith comes from having hope and how that hope can be an anchor for our souls. No matter what we are going through we can turn to our Savior who knows exactly how we are feeling. As we turn toward God and rely on Him, He will help us make it through the hard times! <br/>
<br/>
I am so grateful to be serving as a missionary at this time! This gospel is perfect and Jesus Christ is our Savior. He loves us each individually and understands us perfectly. I love and miss you all and hope you have a great week!<br/>
<br/>
xoxo<br/>

</div><h1>Crusin through Wisconsin</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-8739526875279512069" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/>
<br/>
Cheers from the great state of Wisconsin! I hope all is well back home and that you've had a great week(: Things have been really busy here so I'll do my best to cover all the bases! My MTC District and I arrived in Milwaukee on Wednesday afternoon where we were met by President and Sister Cutler! It was so fun to see them again. They are such sweet people! <br/>
<br/>
Initial Impressions:<br/>
As we exited the airport and headed for the mission home I got my first glimpse of Wisconsin. All I could think was, man it is SO green here! There are trees everywhere! I almost felt claustrophobic because I couldn't see out to the mountains! Ha I miss the mountains a LOT, but it is super pretty here. The weather was cool when we got here, but today it's hot and humid! Thankfully the humidity hasn't been too bad yet, I only feel a little sticky...<br/>
<br/>
Night at the Mission Home:<br/>
They dropped us off at the mission home and fed us a delicious lunch before sending us out tracting! I went out with Sister Griffins who is serving in the Milwaukee area right now. She taught me how to do the door approach thing and we had a blast knocking on doors for a bit! We didn't have any real success at first, but eventually we talked with a man named Dean who took a copy of the Book of Mormon and agreed to read it! It was so sweet! After that we had interviews with President Cutler, orientation, dinner, and a testimony meeting. Testimony meetings are always great, but it was cool to be with my District one last time and see just how much our testimonies have grown over the past couple weeks! I really miss them all! The next day we were all assigned to trainers and sent off to various parts of the mission. Saying goodbye to Sister Escobar was the worst! We're hoping we get to be companions again sometime during the next 18 months(:<br/>
<br/>
Wisconsin Rapids:<br/>
1) The Companion: My new companion and trainer is Sister Christiansen! She's from Orem, Utah and will turn 20 next month. She's been out on her mission for 6 months and has served in Wisconsin Rapids the entire time! The members all love her and always invite us over. She dislocated her ankle while playing volleyball with the ward in May and is still in a boot! She uses crutches and can't walk very fast, but I never hear her complain. They're hoping she won't need surgery because if she does she'll have to go home! Hopefully it'll heal though! Because she's crippled I have to drive! Ha so my second day in Wisconsin was spent driving the 3 hours from Milwaukee to Wisconsin Rapids - it ruled! I like our white Jeep Compass, but wish it was a stick shift. I keep putting my left foot down to change gears out of habit.. Ha the roads here are all bumpy old concrete and there's loads of construction going on so that makes things interesting. Sister Christiansen has a nice GPS that gets us where we need to be though so life is good(:<br/>
2)  The Area: Wisconsin Rapids is cute little "city" though it reminds me more of a small town. There's a river that runs through it and a bunch of cute little old houses. There are ice cream parlors everywhere. We live in a little apartment and there is a little forest right outside our apartment door! <br/>
3) The People: The ward is small, but so awesome! So many different people from different walks of life! Most of the ward is made up of converts who all have incredible conversion stories. We work a lot with the members and they kindly feed us a couple times a week. This week we made our own pizzas at a members house which was fun! Thursday night is 'Sports Night' with the ward where we play kickball, basketball, and volleyball over at the church with members, inactives,and investigators. On Fridays we volunteer in the community by helping out at Bethesda's local thrift shop and the Rehabilitation Center. We talk with people all the time about the church, but everyone thinks we are more modern nuns which is weird. I am definitely not a nun!!! <br/>
<br/>
Personal Study is Powerful!:<br/>
Personal study might very well be my favorite part of the day! I know it sounds crazy, but I love the quiet hour I get to spend each morning studying the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It brings such peace and happiness into my life! I love it! This week I restarted the Book of Mormon so I read 1 Nephi 3 and was blown away by how incredibly obedient Nephi is. I love that he WILLINGLY obeyed the Lord even when it was tough! <br/>
<br/>
I love you all dearly and miss you like crazy, but I send my love from Rapids(:<br/>
xoxo<br/>

<br/>
WE LEAVE FOR WISCONSIN IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS! I could not be more excited to begin this new adventure(: We leave the MTC at 3:30 am and head to the SLC airport where we'll catch a 7:35 am flight to Denver before flying into Milwaukee - ahhhhh! So excited! I don't have much time, but I'll try to give you a small glimpse into my amazing week here at the MTC real quick before we have to go pack!<br/>
<br/>
MTC Highlights:<br/>
I have the best zone ever! Seriously so great. We've loved playing sand volleyball during gym time and eating meals together. I'll miss them loads! Our teachers are amazing and always teach with the spirit. I've learned so much from Sister Westover, Brother Rassmussen, Brother Giffiths, and Brother Darenthal! I've also loved seeing tons of friends on the MTC campus in between classes, gym and meal time!<br/>
<br/>
District BOM Reads:<br/>
One of my favorite things we do as a district is called a "BOM read" where we all just read from the Book of Mormon together and discuss what we're reading. We had a sweet experience this week going over Alma 32 and talking about humility and faith. I know that we can receive personal revelation as we study the scriptures!<br/>
<br/>
Progressing Investigators and the Power of Music:<br/>
This week Sister Escobar and I spent a lot of time teaching our Progressing Investigators. I gained a huge testimony of the importance of teaching by the spirit. It's tough to do, but soo important! The spirit truly is the best teacher. Chad, one of our investigators, loves music so he asked Sister Escobar and I to sing a hymn for him! Ha it was random, but totally brought in the spirit! One more thing.. I got to sing and play the piano for our little zone sacrament meeting yesterday so on Saturday night I got to practice for a little while which was such a fun break!<br/>
<br/>
Hope all is well back home! I love and miss you loads(:

Good news, I survived week one of the MTC. The concept of time in here is so strange - on one hand it seems like I've been here for a day and on the other it seems as if it's been an eternity! The first night I definitely felt like Dorthy on the Wizard of Oz when I looked around and realized I really wasn't in Kansas anymore! Ha but I totally love it, everyone is super nice and the schedule keeps us really busy! </div>
<div class="p2">

<div class="p1">
District 24:</div>
<div class="p1">
I absolutely LOVE my district! Honestly some of the most genuine, hard working kids ever. My companion Sister Escobar is from Nampa, Idaho and loves to read and dance. She's such a good example to me and we get along super well! We love running during gym time and eating oatmeal in the mornings(: She's a bit shy so when we teach I take the lead and then she just hits home the point with her powerful testimony. We share a room with Sisters Biro and Kunz who are also going to the Wisconsin, Milwaukee Mission, in fact our whole district is headed there! Sister Biro is 25, from AZ, and a convert! She has so much faith it's truly inspiring! Sister Kunz is from Washington and loves theatre - she's really animated when she talks, yet super quiet and spiritual when she teaches. Then we have the 18-year-old Elders - Merrill, McDurmott, and Baird. Elder Merrill is from Idaho and loves sports/outdoors stuff. He is super down to earth and easy to get along with. Elder McDurmott is from Layton, UT and has the cheesiest grin you've ever seen. That kid is always smiling. He's hard working and really keeps us going. Elder Baird is from Heber City, UT and loves to sing. He knows the scriptures really well - he puts us all to shame. Ha but we all balance each other out and get along well. We love spending time together and all look out for one another. We had a sweet zone, but they all left us yesterday for the mission field! We are looking forward to getting new zone members today as the new missionaries are dropped off! </div>

Sunshine in My Soul:</div>
<div class="p1">
Our District loves to sing.. ha we sing to start class and everyone gets way into it! Definitely brings in the spirit. Also Sister Escobar and I were called as the District/Zone Music Coordinators so for Sacrament meeting I played the prelude music and lead. We've loved getting to know our Branch Presidency and their wives - the Jenkins, Mays, and LaTurners have become our parents in here! We enjoy the time we get to spend with them after Devotionals and on Sundays. At the Devotional last night Neil A. Anderson spoke about the Holy Ghost which was super powerful. It's so cool that after being baptized we can have the constant companionship of a member of the Godhead if we live worthily!  </div>
<div class="p2">

<div class="p1">
A Day in the Life:</div>
<div class="p1">
The MTC is all about planning so each day we stick to a pretty tight schedule. We wake up at 6:30 and get ready before going to eat breakfast as a District. Next we have classroom instruction where MTC teachers teach us all about the Doctrine of Christ and the Atonement. We practice teaching "investigators" which really means we practice teaching our teachers and they pretend to be progressing investigators. Our progressing investigator's name is Paul and he's the best! Sister Escobar and I have loved teaching "Paul" aka Brother Rassmussen. We also teach TRC (I have no clue what that stands for and I guess no one else does either because we've asked tons of missionaries...) investigators which are realish investigators. In a little bit Sister Escobar and I get to teach Melissa who is a TRC investigator from Milwaukee - so cool! During gym time we run around the track or outside - occasionally we go to the actual gym too. We get to walk up to the temple sometimes, but it's closed right now so we won't get to go through. Other than that we just spend time studying with our awesome teachers Brother Rassmussen and Sister Westover.</div>
<div class="p2">

<div class="p1">
Just a little spiritual thought:</div>
<div class="p1">
D&amp;C 68:6 has been my go to scripture this week. I know that our Savior Jesus Christ lives and loves each of us - this gospel truly brings peace and happiness!</div>

Amanda was set apart last night. It was a very special experience. Sister Kelley spent the morning exercising with her companion (senior Sister Kelley), getting ready for the day, studying, and finishing up packing her suitcases. After a wonderful breakfast of Abelskievers with her family we said good bye to Grandma Barbara and loaded everything up in the car to head down to Provo.<br/>
<br/>
We arrived at the Provo Temple and took a few pictures, ran into the Littles who were sending off Rebecca (Amanda's friend since elementary school) and said our tender goodbyes. We then entered the MTC drop off line and pulled into slot #3. Amanda was greeted, we took a few pictures and hugged one last time! Off she goes…we are so proud of her!<br/>

</div><h1>That's the gas light?</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-6971967302167323765" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>Hey hope you're all doing super well(: Sister Christiansen and I both survived transfers this week so we are still kickin it in good ol' Wisconsin Rapids. At the end of this six week transfer period Sister Christiansen will have been here for 9 months! That's half of her mission! I bet she'll leave next transfer though because her dislocated ankle is getting much better. She's off crutches, out of the boot, and now just hobbles around in an ankle brace. She's a trooper!<br/><br/>The Gas Light:<br/>On Tuesday we drove to Adams-Friendship (about a 45 minute drive) for district meeting and on the way back the gas light turned on... but we were in a hurry to make it to an appointment so we didn't bother stopping for gas. The appointment went well, but ran long so we had to hurry over to our next appointment across town and just figured we'd get gas on our way back home. Unfortunately we pushed the poor Jeep just a bit too hard and we ran out of gas while we were driving along the road! I'd never run out of gas like that before so it was a bit of an adventure, but I managed to pull into a parking lot safely and a member brought us enough gas to make it to the station. So yeah next time I guess I should pay heed to the gas light! Ha the experience ended up being a blessing in disguise though because we changed lesson plans for our later appointment with Adrian and Megan and had an incredible lesson led by the spirit! It was so great!<br/><br/>Not one, but TWO baptismal dates:<br/>The miracle of the week came after the crazy running out of gas adventure when we were able to teach our investigating couple, Adrian and Megan. We had a powerful lesson with them and at the end they accepted the invitation to be baptized!  Their baptismal date is set for either September 27th or 28th depending on Megan's work schedule. They have been coming to church with their 3 little boys and are progressing really well! We are praying that everything will go smoothly so they can be baptized that last weekend in September. The next major hurdle will be explaining that they need to get married BEFORE baptism... so far we've talked to them about marriage and they plan to be married, but were thinking sometime next year. We are praying their hearts will be softened and they will want to get married sooner! They are such great people and have really strong testimonies already! While teaching them on Tuesday night I truly felt the strong love our Heavenly Father has for them. Sister C and I were freaking out afterwards, we were so excited!(:<br/><br/>Humidity Hits Hard:<br/>In all honesty I really missed my iPhone weather app this week! Ha the weather here is so unpredictable! On Thursday it was pouring rain in the morning so we went out in cardigans, but by that afternoon it was blazing hot! I feel like I'm constantly moist from the dang humidity and my hair can't be tamed - it's just a curly poof on my head! One of our recent converts always teases that my "dry weather hair" can't handle the humidity of Wisconsin. I tried to straighten it the other day and it was just curly again by the time I went to bed. Ha good times. Also on Saturday there was this weird fog/mist stuff that fell all day, but it was still sorta hot. I felt like I was in the rain forest or something! People here say this summer has been really mild and that usually it's hot and humid like it was this week all summer long.<br/><br/>Saturdays = Sunday Prep:<br/>Saturdays have become our "work super insanely hard and see loads of miracles happen" days of the week and I love it! We taught 2 lessons with a member present and had 7 other lessons, contacted 2 referrals, found 2 new investigators, visited 1 less active and 2 recent converts, AND passed out 4 copies of the Book of Mormon! It was a stellar day(: And we definitely saw the fruits of our labors when we had 5 investigators show up at church on Sunday! They even stayed for second hour (Gospel Principles) where Sister Christiansen and I taught chapter 29, the Lord's Law of Health. I love working hard and seeing miracles happen! I know this truly is the Lord's work!<br/><br/>Well I hope you all have a fantastic week! Thanks for all the emails, letters, and prayers - they mean so much! Read Mosiah 2:41 sometime - it's a scripture I've liked a lot this week. It made me think about how keeping the commandments brings happiness. I know as we are obedient we can make it to that state of "never-ending happiness" which sounds awesome!(; Love you all!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>I hope you've all had a good week and that you're enjoying the last little bit of summer! Here the weather is starting to get lots cooler and a few of the leaves are starting to change... winter is coming and man am I scared! Everyone says it's going to be super cold in WI this winter! Brrr!<br/><br/>Exchanges in Wausau:<br/>This week started off with Exchanges in Wausau with the Sister Training Leaders (STL's)! I went to Wausau with Sister Jardine and Sister Christiansen stayed in WI Rapids (because of her ankle) with Sister Pearson. Usually they make the new missionary stay in their new area, but Sister Christiansen's ankle is still in a big boot (though she is off her crutches!) so they kept her here to make things easier. That was fine by me because it meant I got to see another part of Wisconsin! Wausau is really hilly so driving (yes I was the designated driver again) was fun, but I can't imagine driving there in the winter when the roads are icy! Yikes! I got to drive the STL's car and must admit I've been spoiled with our Jeep! Ha but exchanges were really fun and I learned a bunch. Sister Jardine is from Canada and has been serving for just over 12 months. She is a great listener and very bold. We had a lesson with one of their investigators, a Hmong girl named PaDay, which went really well. PaDay has two albino Hmong sisters who are SO cute! They look Hmong, but have strawberry blonde hair and really fair skin - they are so adorable! PaDay is so prepared, but her parents won't let her get baptized. I only knew her for a day, but felt SO much love for her! It's crazy how much you learn to love the people you serve out here!<br/><br/>Weird Food of the Week:<br/>Sorry I talk about food so much.. Ha but this week I had to share the meal we had on Tuesday night! We went over to a member's home for dinner and ate RABBIT! But get this, it was a rabbit that had been eating the vegetables in their garden so they caught it and cooked it up for dinner! Ha surprisingly it wasn't bad and I was adventurous enough to try it so I count it as a success. <br/><br/>Madison Mission Tour:<br/>Elder Martino (a member of the Seventy) and his wife came to our mission to do the yearly Mission Tour training this week. Sister Christiansen and I drove 2 hours to Madison on Tuesday night and stayed with the Madison 4th Ward Sisters (Sisters Arnold and Askerland - who knows the Hogue Family in our ward!) before attending the Mission Tour the next day. Our zone and two other zones met in Madison for the final day of the tour. It was great to see some of my MTC friends - Elder Merrill and Sister Kunz - as well as the missionaries in my District and Zone. It was fun to have such a big group of missionaries together and to get to know some new people! The Mission Tour itself was incredible. We were definitely spiritually fed, ha in fact I felt spiritually stuffed!!! Elder Martino really motivated us to work harder and more effectively. He counseled us to 1) open our mouths, 2) increase our faith, 3) become one with God, 4) work smarter and 5) work with members better. He talked about working with members a lot so we are going to try to be better about that this week! Also I loved what he said about becoming one with God. I think this happens as that "mighty change of heart" takes place within each of us and as we more fully align our will with God's. I know God has a plan for each of us and that His plan is always far better than ours. In the Bible Dictionary we learn that through prayer we can align our will more fully with Heavenly Father's - it's so cool that we can talk directly with our Father in Heaven. I know He loves each of us so much and wants to hear from us!<br/><br/>Working Towards a September Baptism:<br/>After the Mission Tour Sister Christiansen and I were pumped to go out and get to work! We've been setting high goals for ourselves and working diligently to meet them. We do a bit of tracting each day to try to find people who will accept a copy of the Book of Mormon and agree to read a specific part of it. We taught a couple of ladies who were out selling vegetables which turned out to be a pretty cool experience. We have a lot of investigators that we are teaching too, but don't have any baptismal dates set right now. There is a mission goal for one baptism in every area before the October General Conference so we are praying to set a baptismal date soon because the WI Rapids area hasn't had a baptism for the goal yet! We are teaching an awesome couple who will hopefully accept a baptismal date this week!<br/><br/>Thanks for all the support and encouragement! I love and miss you all a real lot(:<br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/><div>
Man this week flew by! Here are some of the highlights...<br/><br/>The Cheese Factory:<br/>Last Monday a member family in the ward took Sister Christiansen and I to tour the local cheese factory. It was cool to see how cheese was made and check out all the weird varieties they produce. Some of the weird ones were the jalapeno, blueberry, and chocolate cheese! I finally tried 'squeaky cheese' and must admit it was a bit strange... Ha we got ice cream afterward and talked with the ice cream lady for a while. People in Wisconsin are really passionate about their dairy products!<br/><br/>Old Fat Book = New Favorite Book:<br/>During personal study this week I spent a lot of time learning more about the Apostasy. The light of the Restoration contrasts the darkness of the Great Apostasy so intensely, it's crazy. PMG suggested studying from Talmage's Jesus the Christ, but I must admit I was a bit intimidated to actually open up that book... IT'S HUGE! Ha but I decided to read chapter 40, "The Long Night of Apostasy" and found it to be super insightful! It was cool to understand the history of what was going on and why a reformation wouldn't cut it. I know that Christ's church truly has been restored to the earth in these latter-days and I am grateful that it will never be taken from the earth again.<br/><br/>Oshkosh... Oh my gosh:<br/>This week we traveled to Oshkosh to attend the new missionary training meeting. We drove down on Thursday and stayed with the YSA Sisters in Manesha before driving the last little bit to Oshkosh the next morning. Oshkosh is crazy. There are soo many roundabouts! The GPS had to redirect us a bunch! Ha but eventually we made it to the Stake Center and met all the new missionaries from my MTC district, their companions, the AP's, and President and Sister Cutler. It was fun to see all my MTC buds again, especially Sister Escobar! I love her! The training was really helpful and definitely motivated me to keep progressing. Because there are so many different parts of missionary work and so many high expectations I feel a bit overwhelmed and inadequate at times, but I am determined to do a little better each day! I know that if I am doing my best the Lord will take care of the rest - this truly is His work!<br/><br/>Anticipating Miracles:<br/>After training Sister Christiansen and I were super pumped! We set some really high goals for ourselves and prayed that as we worked diligently we'd be able to accomplish our goals. So we set out the next day and worked as hard as we could and sure enough.. miracles happened! We were given a service opportunity to help a recent convert with some yard work, visited a few less active members, invited an investigator to church AND THEY CAME ON SUNDAY!!! We were discouraged that the referrals we tried to contact weren't home, but we tracted in those neighborhoods instead and found a new investigator! After all the role plays we had done the day before at training, I felt confident as I taught and was able to pass out a couple copies of the Book of Mormon with specific reading assignments as well. I was so grateful for the miracles we saw and can't wait to see what this weeks brings!<br/><br/>Hope all is going well back home! Thanks for the letters and emails, they always make my day(: Love you lots!<br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley</div>

</div><h1>I'm One Happy Missionary</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7466137776373403327" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>Greetings from the wet little city of Wisconsin Rapids! It's been pouring here today so driving was a bit sketchy, but we've been able to do our laundry, grocery shopping, and make it to the library to email so life is good(:<br/><br/>The Adams-Friendship Missionaries:<br/>This week we got to drive to Adams for district meeting! We've got 8 missionaries in our district - 2 sets of Elders and 2 sets of Sisters. Elders Williams and Hadlock are serving in Adams and Sisters Bennet and Roper serve in Friendship. Then there's Elders Broadus and Kirk who serve with Sister Christiansen and I in Wisconsin Rapids. We switch off locations for district meeting each week, but this time it was in their area so we got to drive through part of the great Wisconsin wilderness! Ha it really seems like a wilderness of sorts because there are SO many trees! They're everywhere along with the many random little lakes and streams. Wisconsin is a pretty place, but I sure miss the mountains! Anyway district meeting is always fun because the other missionaries serving here rule! It is fun to hear about their missionary experiences and to learn and grow together. Elder Williams, our district leader, taught about how to use the Book of Mormon more effectively in our teaching. In Preach My Gospel is says "the Book of Mormon, combined with the Spirit, is your most powerful resource in conversion" (page 104). I thought that was super powerful and want to encourage each of you to spend time studying the Book of Mormon this week. I know it will help deepen your own conversion. <br/><br/>Faith to Find:<br/>As part of our daily study we have what is called "12 Weeks Training" which is just a manual my trainer and I study together. It goes through the fundamentals of missionary work and we role play a bunch of different situations to practice what to say and how to say it. This week part of the training was about developing the faith to find people to teach. Sister Christiansen and I studied this section together then had a really cool tracting experience where what we had studied totally applied! So we were knocking doors trying to give out a copy of the Book of Mormon without much luck when we saw a nice old lady outside who was trying to set out her garden hose. We were excited to see someone outside and thought she'd be the one for sure! Unfortunately, she really didn't want to talk to us and sent us on our merry way almost immediately. We kept walking though and had faith that we'd find someone we could give a copy of the Book of Mormon to and BAM! We met a lady named Tricia who was outside smoking and playing with her grandson. We got talking with her about families and were able to get her number and will be teaching her sometime in the next few weeks! It was such a great testimony building moment for me as I realized that if I have the faith to find, Heavenly Father will make it possible.<br/><br/>A Full Pew at Church:<br/>We were pretty bummed when none of our investigators showed up at church this week so we sat down in the chapel with a young mother and her kids. Then while we were singing the opening hymn, an investigator family we've been teaching walked in! They filed into the seats next to us and as I sat squished next to Sister Christinasen I just couldn't help smiling! I am one happy missionary! They stayed for all three hours and had a great experience. The ward was very welcoming and the little boys loved primary. It was awesome! I can't wait to see how Adrian and Megan continue to progress.<br/><br/>Greenie Meal:<br/>This week we had some pretty delicious member meals, but the highlight was with the Flinders family last night for Break the Fast. Since I am a new missionary or "greenie" they served what they call the "Greenie Meal" where all the food is green! They made green eggs and ham, green potatoes, green waffles, and a green fruity drink. The members here are so good to the missionaries - what a fun missionary tradition!<br/><br/>Oh one more thing that happened this week... I officially reached my 1 month mark! Hooray! To celebrate, a member family is taking us to tour the local cheese factory in a little bit - ha should be a real adventure(: Hope you all have a great week!<br/><br/>Peace and love,<br/>Sister Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

Dear Family and Friends,</div>
<div>
<br/>
For some reason this seemed like a really long week... I hope the next few days go by quickly because I can't wait for General Conference! I am so pumped!!!<br/>
<br/>
Exchanges in Rapids:<br/>
We had exchanges this week so Sister Pearson (one of the Wausau Sister Training Leaders) came to Rapids to work with me for the day and Sister Christiansen got to go to Wausau to work with the other STL, Sister Jardine! I loved getting to know Sister Pearson and serving with her. She's from Cedar, UT and loves to run. We had an awesome morning workout together! We went on a sweet run - I loved the crisp fall air and crunch of the leaves beneath our feet. Great way to start our day! Sister Pearson and I taught some powerful lessons together. I loved learning from her and seeing different ways to do things. Our day was really full, but we ended up having some extra time before an appointment so we decided to tract for a bit. We used a family history approach and it totally worked! We gave out two copies of the Book of Mormon and met this really solid family who want to meet with us again! Such a tender mercy! I can't wait to go back and teach them again! I hope they are the answer to our prayers - we have been trying to find a family who will progress!<br/>
<br/>
Passenger Perks:<br/>
While on exchanges Sister Christiansen had to drive! Apparently it went really well and her ankle didn't have any problems so she came back and wanted to drive our car as well. As the Senior Companion she now is the designated driver... aww man! Ha so now I ride in the passenger seat and get to enjoy the pretty fall leaves even more(:<br/>
<br/>
It's beginning to look a lot like.. Halloween?:<br/>
I don't know what it is, but people here are HUGE into Halloween. The yards are packed full of decorations and everyone is buying candy! We joined in the festivities by putting up some Halloween stickers in our apartment window. <br/>
<br/>
Less Active Love:<br/>
This week we reached out to some of our less actives just to let them know that we love them and want them to come unto Christ. We had a really cool lesson about recognizing the spirit with on of LA ladies in the ward. She has been coming to church a bit more lately and is doing so well - we have been making sure people fellowship her in Relief Society which has been helping a lot! There is another LA in the ward and have been encouraging to read the Book of Mormon and to quit smoking. He has been reading 3 chapters from the BOM every night since we taught him and he was at church on Sunday! It seems like sometimes all the less actives need is someone who loves them and genuinely cares.<br/>
<br/>
I'm Not a Nun!:<br/>
While doing service at the rehabilitation center we were able to talk with one of the nurses about what we do as missionaries. She thought we were nuns... ha so typical. Everyone thinks we are nuns. We actually had a really cool conversation with her and invited her to hear some of our lessons! She didn't accept, but she didn't refuse either so we will keep trying! While at the rehab center we also visited Sister Skibba - a 90 year-old lady from the ward who recently had a stroke and was put in the rehab center. She is still kickin and was totally alert when we talked to her. She is such a sweet woman and has such a strong testimony. When one of her nurses was helping her she introduced us to her and talked with the nurse about missionary work! Sister Skibba is amazing - such a great member missionary! I want to be like that when I'm a 90 year-old woman!<br/>
<br/>
Temple Trip:<br/>
Two of our not so recent 'recent converts' went to the temple to receive their endowments this week! I wish we could have gone with them, but we are too far away! The closest temple is the St. Paul Temple in Minnesota which is a little over 3 hours away. I wish Wisconsin had a temple! I love the temple and was so glad Sister Krause and Sister Wendt had the chance to go. In the General Women's Meeting broadcast the temple was brought up a ton! We truly are so blessed to be living at a time where so many beautiful temples dot the earth(: I am so grateful for the work that is done in the temple and for the peace felt there.<br/>
<br/>
Follow Up Frenzy:<br/>
Alright one last thing.. on Saturday Sister Christiansen and I had a follow up frenzy! We got our list of potential investigators and those we have given a copy of the Book of Mormon to recently and went to town! We contacted a bunch of people on the list and were able to teach Sarah, a young mother, about the Restoration. It went pretty well, but we are still looking for people who are truly interested. We are working with some investigators now, but they aren't progressing at all. It is frustrating! We want them to come unto Christ and experience the fullness of joy that the gospel brings, but people have their agency and sometimes choose not to! We plan to have another 'follow up frenzy' this week to see if anyone wants to learn more!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all have a wonderful General Conference weekend - we are so blessed to be led by a living Prophet!<br/>
<br/>
xoxo<br/>

Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>This has definitely been a week of learning! The challenges come and go, but I rely on my Savior Jesus Christ!<br/><br/>Vehicle Inspections:<br/>During district meeting this week we had vehicle inspections. Our district leader, Elder Williams, had to check each car so we were there for a long time! While we were waiting one of the Wisconsin Rapids Elders taught us all how to change a tire. That was fun! Our cute little Jeep Compass - a.k.a. the Panther - passed inspections and works great. It has a killer turn radius. We love it. Sister Christiansen's ankle is slowly starting to heal so she may be able to start driving again soon. We'll see. <br/><br/><div>
Sports Night:<br/>Every Thursday we have sports night at the church where members of the ward come and bring their friends to play in the gym. It is a great way for us to meet people and do missionary work! We pray and share a scripture/short lesson at the beginning then play volleyball, basketball, kickball, etc. all together. The past few weeks Crystal, one of the young women in the ward, has been bringing her friend Leah. This week we were able to share our testimonies and give Leah a copy of the Book of Mormon! We had a really cool lesson with her and some of the young women who were there bore their testimonies. It was so powerful. I am really excited to teach Leah again this week! She's awesome! <br/><br/>Super Saturday:<br/>This week we helped out with the Relief Society super Saturday activity and invited a few investigators to attend as well! Sister Christiansen and I made a lattice top apple pie and a beaded model of the Salt Lake Temple! All the Sisters seemed to have a good time - I'd say the activity was a success!<br/><br/>Sock Miracle:<br/>We've been doing our best to talk to everyone and this week we had a cool experience with a guy on a bike! One of our investigators had cancelled on us so we were out tracting and had just met this awesome lady who had accepted a copy of the Book or Mormon. We were heading back to the car when we saw this guy coming towards us on a bike dragging a wagon full of laundry behind him. We said hello and wanted to stop and talk with him, but he biked passed us. Then a heaven sent gust of wind knocked a sock out of his wagon so he stopped and we ran over to talk to him! He accepted a copy of the Book of Mormon and agreed to meet with us a few days later! We met with him and a friend of his yesterday to talk more about the Book of Mormon and it went so well! We cleared up their concerns about Mormons having lots of wives.. and now they seem genuinely interested in learning more. I can't wait for them to start reading! <br/><br/>Obedience Talk:<br/>I gave a talk in Sacrament meeting yesterday so that was fun. Ha it actually went really well and I learned a lot while preparing it. I was assigned to speak about obedience. I studied messages from the April 2014 General Conference and really liked "Spiritual Whirlwinds" by Elder Andersen, “If Ye Love Me, Keep My Commandments” by Elder Hales, and "Obedience through Our Faithfulness" by Elder Perry. I definitely recommend rereading those ones - they are awesome! I especially loved this quote from Elder Perry's talk, "Strong, proactive obedience is anything but weak or passive. It is the means by which we declare our faith in God and qualify ourselves to receive the powers of heaven. Obedience is a choice. It is a choice between our own limited knowledge and power and God’s unlimited wisdom and omnipotence." Pretty neat to think about. Obedience truly does bring blessings into our lives!<br/><br/>Alright I think that's about it. We've got exchanges this week and transfers coming up in a couple weeks. I'm getting stoked for General Conference! Fall is in full swing here. It's beautiful! I'll try to take pictures of the changing leaves this week(: Love you all and hope things are going well!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley</div>

</div><h1>Waiting for the Silver Lining</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-3923356487955003107" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>This week was a bit of a roller coaster - so many ups and downs!<br/><br/>A Whole Lot of Heartache:<br/>We had a hard week as our two progressing investigators with baptismal dates, dropped us. They are no longer meeting with us and have decided to look for another church. We are heart broken. After teaching and reteaching them about the Law of Chastity I felt like a failure when they ultimately decided not to be married or baptized. I know they have their agency and that this is their choice, but it is still hard. We still have a good relationship with them and are praying they will change their minds, but for now there isn't a whole lot we can do. We are going to try to have some of their member fellow shippers reach out to them.<br/><br/>Zone Training in Wausau:<br/>On Tuesday the Adams-Friendship Sisters met us at our apartment so we could drive to Wausau together. It was fun to talk with Sisters Ostler and Roper and get to know them better. They are both from Utah.  Sister Ostler is from Ephraim and Sister Roper is from Taylorsville. I swear all the missionaries here are from the West! Anyway we had a great time at Zone Training and learned how to be more consecrated missionaries. Sacrifice and consecration are so important! I love how Omni 1:26 talks about offering our "whole souls as an offering unto him." As we sacrifice things that we want and consecrate ourselves to the Lord, He WILL bless us! <br/><br/>Love to the End:<br/>Something that was shared in Zone Training got me thinking a lot this week.. it was the idea that we should not just endure to the end, but we should LOVE to the end. I think sometimes we get focused on just enduring through something, but in 2 Nephi 2:25 it explains we are meant to experience joy in this life! Joy comes when we learn to live with a "come what may and love it" attitude. When we look at every experience as a good experience and focus on the positive we are naturally happier(:<br/><br/>Sister Christiansen's Birthday:<br/>This week my companion turned 20!!! Whoop whoop! We spent the day eating cake and ice cream, oh and saving souls! Ha we taught some really great lessons and had a delicious dinner with a recent convert family. She loves Harry Potter so I had Trevor make her a wand on his lathe so I gave that to her and she was soo happy! Definitely a great birthday!<br/><br/>I've Missed My Jeans:<br/>One of the recent convert families in the ward moved across town so we spent a lot of time helping them move this week! We were happy to wear pants and spend time with their sweet family(:<br/><br/>Hot Chocolate Already?:<br/>This week Wisconsin Rapids was hit with an early cold spell! With the changing leaves and cooler weather it feels more like the end of October than the middle of September. Unfortunately our apartment complex hadn't turned on the boiler yet so we've been freezing! It has been colder inside our apartment than outside! Ha so we bundled up and have been drinking lots of hot cocoa!<br/><br/>Well I think that's about it! Hope school is going well and that you are all staying busy(: I love and miss you, but am grateful for the opportunity to serve as a missionary and help out with this great work! I know this is the Lord's work! Hope you have a great week!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley

</div><h1>A Familiar Face?</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-1323454604051905735" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>We've had a good week here in Rapids. The weather is cooling down nicely and I'm getting excited to break out the sweaters and cardigans! We've been told the Farmer's Almanac is predicting this winter to be as bad or worse than it was last year here in Wisconsin so we'll be bundling up here pretty soon... brrrrr!<br/><br/>Interviews with President Cutler:<br/>President Cutler came to our district meeting in Adams-Friendship this week to conduct interviews. Apparently we have personal interviews with the President every 3 months or so. It was nice to talk with him and receive counsel. Sister Christiansen and I were grateful we had the chance to talk with him about some of the specific concerns some of our investigators have. He helped guide and direct us and also answered some of the questions I'd been having about how to teach with the spirit. He gave us each a copy of a talk given by Elder Oaks titled, 'Teaching and Learning by the Spirit' which has helped a ton!<br/><br/>Community Special Needs Dance:<br/>This week we had the opportunity to help out with an activity put on by the community for those with special needs! The community organized the event, but the ward here in Rapids supplied dinner before the dance so we got to help serve food! The Young Women came to help out as well and we had a great time providing service! It reminded me of helping set up the Kauri Sue Hamilton Prom in high school, but this time instead of Little Mermaid decorations there were Green Bay Packer decorations(: Ha it was so much fun to spend time with the Young Women and serve the community. Sister Christiansen and I were smiling the entire time! Seriously so much fun!<br/><br/>Who are these people?:<br/>So apparently I have a super familiar face or something because this week two random ladies came over and struck up a conversation with me as if they knew me! I had no idea who they were, but they chatted with me as if we were long lost friends.. it was strange. I gave them <a href="http://mormon.org/">mormon.org</a> cards. <br/><br/>The Gospel Blesses Families:<br/>We've been trying to work with the members better and really help our investigators gain not only a spiritual conversion, but a social conversion as well. We want them to develop friendships with members of the ward so we've been setting up lots of member present lessons. This week we had one of our investigators come over to the home of one of the members she knows pretty well. We wanted to teach a lesson in an environment where the spirit could be felt. We'd planned to teach the Plan of Salvation, but the kids were really noisy so we ended up teaching the 10 Commandments where the kids could do the hand signals! Even though our investigators kids were a bit rowdy it ended up working out and the member's kids were great examples to their friends! I am grateful for how the gospel blesses families and helps parents teach their kids in love and righteousness!<br/><br/>Tracting Tales:<br/>We did a lot of tracting this week. We struggled to find someone who would accept a copy of the Book of Mormon each day, but Heavenly Father always ended up leading us to where we needed to be so we could meet that goal! We talked with everyone and anyone we could find! It's funny because sometimes people open the door and look really scared of us! Ha I don't know why - I mean what's so scary about a couple of 19 year old girls in skirts knocking on your door? Ha we are doing our best to find those who are prepared! <br/><br/>Eating Alligator:<br/>This week we were fed alligator at a member's home! Ha it tasted and was prepared just like a chicken nugget! Ha pretty random meal, but a fun mission experience!<br/><br/>Fasting and Prayer:<br/>I had such a neat experience while fasting yesterday - I totally received an answer to my prayer while reading the scriptures! When we read about fasting in the scriptures it is always talked about with prayer. Prayer is an essential part of fasting. Check out Alma 5:45-46 and Alma 17:2-3, 9. I know Heavenly Father is mindful of each of us individually!<br/><br/>I love you guys and hope you all have a fantastic week!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>Pulling Teeth</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-6922437108634066640" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>Well this week is just a blur... we've been so busy I'm honestly having a hard time remembering what happened! Ha but I'll do my best so here goes..<br/><br/>Dental Floss and Door Knobs:<br/>We had a busy week teaching investigators, recent converts, and less actives, but one of the highlights was an object lesson we taught on Friday night. We were visiting a less active lady in the ward and her 11 year old daughter Sophia. While we were there Sophia was complaining about a loose tooth that was bothering her. I had her show it to me and saw that her back molar was literally hanging on by a single root. She was really nervous she might swallow it, but was too scared to pull it out so I offered to help. What started as a joke turned into a fun object lesson and Sister Christiansen and I got to play dentist for a bit! I tied some dental floss around her tooth and Sister C tied the other end of the floss to a door knob and we shut the door and pulled out the tooth very gently(: Sophia was happy her tooth came out and we were happy to tie it into the blessings that come after enduring trials. It seemed to hit home to her Mom and we left feeling quite accomplished.<br/><br/>Tracting in the Rain:<br/>We do a bit of tracting everyday because we have a mission-wide goal of passing out one copy of the Book of Mormon with a specific reading assignment each day to someone who will read it. Going door to door is a bit rough sometimes, but occasionally you find a 'diamond in the rough' which makes tracting worthwhile. This week we didn't find any 'diamonds' per say, but we sure had some fun times! We were out tracting on Saturday afternoon, but were having a hard time finding people who would listen to us. We walked for a long time and still hadn't found anyone. Randomly it starting raining, but it wasn't raining very hard so we kept going. It starting pouring, but by that time we were so far from the car we couldn't really do anything about it. We laughed and thankfully the rain let up after a couple of minutes. Our once straight hair was crazy curly from the humidity and our clothes were damp, but we still had to find someone who would accept a copy of the Book of Mormon so we kept going! The sun came out and we dried out a bit and FINALLY we were able to give a copy of the Book of Mormon to a nice guy named Vince. We went a bit further and met another man who also accepted a BOM - so sweet!<br/><br/>YW Activity:<br/>A few weeks ago we were asked to teach the Young Women about how to care for their bodies. For Young Women's this week we planned a beauty night activity where we taught the girls that our bodies are gifts from God and that we should take care of them. We went over some personal hygiene tips - showering, make up, and hair - then talked about modesty. The activity turned out really well and we all had a good time. We did their make up and hair then had some hand scrub stuff at the end that they all really liked. There aren't very many youth in the ward. I think there are less than 10 young women total! We are trying to find good families to teach to help strengthen the ward, but we are having a hard time finding people who will progress!<br/><br/>Answers to Prayer:<br/>My testimony of prayer was strengthened SO much this week! Sister Christiansen and I saw a couple huge miracles after asking Heavenly Father for help with specific things through prayer. Adrian and Megan, our investigating couple with a baptismal date, aren't married so we have been praying their hearts will be softened towards marriage. We have been praying that they'll get married before the end of the month so they can be baptized on the date we've set with them (September 27th). When we first started talking to them about marriage they weren't planning on getting married until the end of 2016 and just yesterday they said they want to get married within the next 40 days! Ahhh! Such an answer to our prayers! Now we just need to pray that they will get married in the next 20 days or so... We are really working to get a baptism in our area before the October General Conference! I'm so grateful for the power of prayer and know that God hears and answers each of us! <br/><br/>Hope you all had a relaxing labor day and are getting used to the back to school schedule(: I love and miss you dearly! Have a great week!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>Wausau Stake Conference</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7219463985376514424" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>It's been a whirlwind of a week - I can't believe Halloween is just around the corner! Where has this month gone?! People here in Rapids go all out for Halloween - seriously almost every house has some type of spooky decor up and people have already started carving pumpkins! <br/><br/>Experiences with the Book of Mormon:<br/>This week my testimony and love for the Book of Mormon grew SO much! I've loved reading the Book of Mormon with a special emphasis on Jesus Christ and His Atonement as part of a mission-wide Christmas challenge. While I was reading this week, Jacob 3:1-2 really stood out to me and I thought a lot about what it means to have a firmness of mind. The cross references in Alma 57:27 and Alma 58:40 are super cool - look them up(: Early this week Sister Christiansen and I had the opportunity to attend a Relief Society scripture study activity where we read/answered questions from a few chapters in Mormon and Moroni. I'm grateful for the efforts they made to keep a record of their people and to keep the plates safe! Then later in the week we implemented some zone training we'd received a few weeks ago and taught our investigators Dakota and Jeff about the Book of Mormon by drawing a map of the world and explaining how God revealed things to the Jews and His people in the Americas. We also talked about the similarities between the BOM and the Bible. Both lessons went really well and we were able to commit them to read and pray for a witness of the truth. Oh how I love the Book of Mormon!!!<br/><br/>Bathtub Issues:<br/>The pipes in our apartment complex got backed up this week so we had junk coming up from our bathtub drain! It was super nasty! Our apartment manager is a super nice guy so we got in contact with him and he called in the repairmen. Unfortunately it took a few days for the repairmen to come out and fix it so we couldn't shower... Ha so we washed our hair in the bathroom sink which was an adventure(:<br/><br/>Wausau Stake Conference:<br/>The Wausau Stake Conference was definitely the highlight of this week! It was so cool to see everyone gathered together to receive instruction and be edified. President Worthin, a member of the 70 and the current BYU President, came and gave two super powerful talks! His invitation was to live the gospel joyfully and invite others to act! He talked about how now is the time for us to increase our faith. Faith is not only a feeling, but a decision. We can increase our faith by developing a closer relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ through prayer, studying the life and teachings of Jesus Christ by reading the scriptures, and making and keeping covenants. The entire conference was about hastening the work of salvation and the spirit was soo thick. As we sang the closing hymn I thought my heart was gonna bust open it was so full! At that moment I felt such a strong love for the people of Wisconsin and the members of the Wausau Stake. I just want to go out and serve them!<br/><br/>Priesthood Power:<br/>As if Stake Conference didn't give me enough of a spiritual high - one of our recent converts, Gary, received the Melchizedek Priesthood right after conference on Sunday! Standing in the room with him and his family was such an incredible experience. I felt the spirit so strongly and couldn't stop smiling! Gary has such a strong testimony and will be a great source of strength to his family and friends! I am so grateful for the power of the Priesthood and how it blesses families!<br/><br/>Thanks so much for all the letters, emails, and packages. I love and miss you all very much, but I'm so grateful for the opportunity I have to serve the people here in Wisconsin(: Hope you have a Happy Halloween and a great week!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>Meet the Mormons!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-6559100040825135604" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/>
<br/>
This week went by crazy fast! We did lots of service and taught some really good lessons as well. Just the typical missionary life I guess(: Hope all is well for you guys back home! <br/>
<br/>
Mission Wide Christmas Book of Mormon Read:<br/>
At the beginning of the month President and Sister Cutler invited us to read the Book of Mormon together as a mission. What a cool opportunity for us to come closer to Christ and show our faith in Him! They promised reading the Book of Mormon together would help unify us as companions and help us become more effective witness of Christ. As we read we are marking scriptures about the nature of Christ and His Atonement in red and the scriptures about what we need to do to receive power through the Atonement in green. We read about 7 pages a day to stay on schedule which takes a while, but has been so cool! I am learning so much about Jesus Christ and His infinite Atonement! We'll have a red and green marked Book of Mormon just in time for Christmas(:<br/>
<br/>
Zone Training in Wausau and Meet the Mormons:<br/>
On Tuesday the Adams-Friendship Sisters (Sisters Ostler and Roper) drove down to Wausau with us for Zone Training. It is always fun to be together as a zone(: Plus President and Sister Cutler came! We had fun talking with them and getting to know the new missionaries who transferred in. During the training we talked about how to make our personal studies more sacred and then got to watch the new church documentary 'Meet the Mormons'! It was so nice to watch a full-length movie! Ha I would definitely recommend it(: I hope lots of people go see it and that it helps non-members understand more about who we are!<br/>
<br/>
Birthday Ninjas:<br/>
This week Sister Christiansen and I were super sneaky birthday ninjas! Ha we totally surprised one of our recent converts by heart attacking her family room while she was sleeping in the other room. We are soo stealthy(:<br/>
<br/>
Strictly Service:<br/>
We got to wear pants so much this week - it was the best! Ha but really I love doing service! On Wednesday we helped Amber, a less active lady who works a ton, deep clean her bathrooms, assemble her new vacuum, and clean out her couches. On Thursday we helped Sister Stoflet tape her drywall so they can begin mudding and get their new house built before winter! On Friday we helped out at the Rehab Center and on Saturday we helped the Khang family pack up and move!<br/>
<br/>
Mediterranean Meal:<br/>
We were invited over to the Bishop's house for dinner this week and they made Gyros - this flat bread with fresh veggies, meat, and yogurt sauce! Mmm! It was fun to get to know the Black family better and we had a good lesson with them where we invited them to pray for one of our investigators. The next day we had an incredible lesson with her and knew it was because of their prayers! When the members and missionaries work together miracles happen!<br/>
<br/>
Miracle of the Week:<br/>
Speaking of miracles.. I better explain this 'incredible lesson' we had. We were teaching Carol, one of our most promising investigators, about tithing. We were a bit nervous about teaching this principle to her because her financial situation isn't the greatest. We prayed she would be open to our message and that her heart would be softened. Sister Neukirchen came to the lesson with us on Thursday and it went SO well! Seriously don't think it could have been more perfect. I definitely felt the spirit and know Carol did as well! We began by telling her that the church doesn't have a paid ministry. She really liked the fact that the leaders of the church fulfill their callings because they love the Lord and not just because they want to be paid. We explained that when we pay our tithing the "windows of heaven will be opened to us" then we testified of the blessings we've received from paying tithing. Carol committed to pay tithing when she gets baptized and was talking about baptism a ton! Now she just needs to get rid of her male roommate... Ha one miracle at a time I guess(:<br/>
<br/>
Well I think that's about all for this week! Thanks for the letters and emails, I love hearing from you! <br/>
<br/>
xoxo<br/>
Sister Kelley<br/>

</div><h1>Not going to Heaven??</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-2255018318035013566" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>How are you all doing?! Hope things are going well(: I've gotta admit this week was a little long at times, but Sister Christiansen and I sure had a lot of fun and saw some sweet miracles!<br/><br/>P-day Adventures:<br/>Alright so I'll be honest.. our P-days basically consist of doing laundry, writing letters, grocery shopping, emailing, and cleaning the apartment all day, BUT last Monday afternoon some members in the ward took us to a nearby game farm! It was fun to drive through and enjoy the bright colors of the changing leaves. About halfway through the farm there was a trail head so we hiked up to this big lookout spot! It reminded me of hiking up at the cabin which made me miss the mountains a ton! It was nice to go on a little hike here though and spend some time outside(:<br/><br/>Painting, Pants, and the Plan of Salvation:<br/>This week we helped Leslie, a less active in the ward, paint her nursery! We'd been to visit her a few times, but while we were doing service she really opened up! She talked about her testimony and her desire for her husband to join the church so they can come to church together. They are expecting their first child together and she hopes this 'big life event' will make him think more seriously about God and want to learn more. She said we can come teach him about the Plan of Salvation in a family home evening sometime soon! Yay! I love doing service! Oh and any excuse to wear pants is a plus(;<br/><br/>Highlight Lessons of the Week:<br/>This week we had some really cool lessons with our investigators Carol, Sara, and BeeJay. Carol is in her 60's and has been investigating for a while now. She reads the Book of Mormon faithfully, but can't be baptized because she has a male roommate... We taught her about the temple on Thursday then we saw her again on Saturday and she said she had been thinking about the temple a lot and really wants to go inside someday! She understands that she must be baptized and be living worthily in order to enjoy the blessings of the temple so we are praying she will have the desire and strength to make the necessary changes! We also taught Sara who is in her mid-20's and is a super cute, hip, young Mom. She's expecting her 3rd child and is due any day! We met her while out tracting and have been over a couple times, but she hasn't taken our lessons very seriously. This week we taught about the Plan of Salvation and she asked some really good questions! We are praying her heart will be soften and that she will be open to learning more! Finally BeeJay. Ha BeeJay is just the cutest Grandma ever! She is very Lutheran, but loves us coming over to teach her new things. We got into a really good discussion about repentance and working each day to become a little better than we were the day before. It was awesome and I felt the spirit super strong for sure. We're struggling to get investigators to want to progress right now, but we are praying the Lord will continue to work with them and soften their hearts! I know as we teach by the spirit their hearts will be touched!<br/><br/>I Guess I'm Not Going to Heaven?:<br/>Oh boy.. this was the worst. Ha we'd gone to see a potential investigator, but she wasn't home so we started tracting around the neighborhood. We noticed a cute house across the street with a car parked out front so we walked over there and knocked on the door. A woman answered and started talking with us... ha she explained that she was Baptist and therefore knew that she had been saved through Jesus Christ and that she was going to heaven when she died. She proceeded to tell us that what we were doing as missionaries was pointless because one cannot 'work their way to heaven.' At that point we were trying to leave, but she noticed the Book of Mormon in our hands and went on about the Bible being perfect how it is and that nothing should be added to or taken from it. We tried to leave, but the woman just kept going! Ha finally she informed us that 'if we continued on the path that we were on we would not make it into heaven...' Ouch. Ha as we walked away Sister Christiansen and I just had big smiles on our faces - we figure if you don't approach and leave the door with a smile you've lost half the battle.<br/><br/>Lincoln High Homecoming Week:<br/>It was Homecoming week at Lincoln High so we heard all about spirit day, the football game, and the dance from the youth in the ward(: On Saturday we helped Liz, a recent convert, get ready for the dance. We had a blast doing her makeup, nails, and hair! It was so much fun and she looked darling(: Her dress was sleeveless, but she made the choice to wear one of Sister Christiansen's cardigans. She's amazing!<br/><br/>Well I think that about sums up my week. We said goodbye to Elder Broadus and met Elder Neville who will be serving here in Rapids with Elder Kirk. We're doing our best to find people who will strengthen the ward and who want to progress. It is cool to see how the gospel changes people - I love how it is changing me and all that I am learning. Being a missionary rules! Keep doing the little things, I love and miss ya all(:<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>General Conference</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-3969593816709416414" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/>
<div>
<br/>
Man, everything this week just revolved around General Conference - it was awesome! I hope you all had a chance to watch it(:<br/>
<br/>
Conference Prep: <br/>
Sister Christiansen and I wanted to get our investigators, recent converts, and less actives pumped about watching conference so we taught a bunch of really cool lessons about prophets and receiving revelation to help people get excited! We love object lessons so we came up with a fun one to talk about the importance of going to conference with a SPECIFIC question in mind and preparing to receive an answer to that question through personal revelation. I'll do my best to explain the lesson, but if it doesn't make sense just know it was super awesome and we felt like geniuses because we made it up ourselves(: So we had a bag of bread with a twisty tie, a jar of peanut butter, a bottle of jam, a knife, and a blind fold. We blind-folded one of the people we were teaching then asked them to walk us through the steps of making a peanut butter and jam sandwich. They'd walk us through it, but weren't specific in their instructions so usually the bread never made it out of the bag (because they forgot to tell us to untie the twisty tie) or they'd forget to have us open the peanut butter jar. Anyway we'd unblind- fold them and they'd realize they hadn't been specific enough. So then we'd discuss how we need to ask specific questions in order to get specific answers - super cool lesson.<br/>
<br/>
Watching Conference:<br/>
As missionaries we watch conference at the church and are allowed to watch one session in a member's home. We wanted to get loads of people to watch it at the church with us so we told everyone about it! We also promised we'd have hot chocolate chip cookies waiting at the church if they came to watch it with us so we did a lot of baking and had a great turn out - lots of investigators, recent converts, and less actives came! Ha we used Sister Cutler's recipe (which can feed a small army) so we had plenty of cookies to go around(: We also made conference bingo cards which everyone seemed to enjoy. Sister Christiansen and I watched the Sunday morning session with the Rapids Elders at the home of one of the members in the ward. Conference was such a great experience - such a spiritual feast!<br/>
<br/>
Touching Talks:<br/>
Picking a General Conference favorite is hard.. they were all so good! I especially liked Elder Klebingat's talk about increasing our spiritual confidence before God. Oh and I thought it was cool that a few different speakers talked about how the Sacrament should be a sacred experience. The Sacrament is such a blessing in our lives and lately I've been trying to make my experience during the Sacrament more meaningful so I was grateful for this guidance. I am excited to talk about Conference with our investigators this week and to put what was taught into action!!!<br/>
<br/>
Transfers - Goodbye to Elder Broadus:<br/>
We got the transfer text on Saturday and found out that Sister Christiansen is staying in Rapids! She will have been here for 10 months - that is 7 transfers! Crazy! Her ankle is finally healing though so we are guessing this will be her last transfer here, but we are excited we get to stay together! We celebrated by making a missionary rap(: One day maybe you'll get to see it.. the file was too big to send.. Anyway we are excited to be together, but we are loosing Elder Broadus - one of the WI Rapids Elders in our ward! We will miss him, but he is going to be a great District Leader in West Bend! We are looking forward to meeting Elder Kirk's new comp next week.<br/>
<br/>
Reaching out to the Less Actives:<br/>
Another highlight of the week was a lesson we taught to a less active in a member's home. We didn't know this less active very well, but knew she was friends with one of the ward members so we set up a time to meet all together. Being in the member's home made all the difference in the world! We got to know the less active and shared a powerful spiritual message with her. Though it is sometimes hard to coordinate around busy schedules, working with members is key to helping less actives feel loved and important!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all have a great week and apply what you learned during conference!<br/>
xoxo<br/>

</div><h1>Tell the Glove Story Again!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-385871244697636142" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>This week has been insane! I felt like it was the longest/fastest/craziest week of my life!<br/><br/>Farewell WI Rapids:<br/>It was so hard to leave Wisconsin Rapids! I am so grateful for all the experiences I had there and all the amazing people I got to work with. The ward members are incredible and I can't wait to hear about how our investigators with baptismal dates continue to progress! Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning were spent running around saying goodbye to everyone, plus I had to pack everything up and get ready to leave! On Wednesday morning we drove to the transfer point at Stevens Point where I got to say goodbye to the Wausau Zone. Saying goodbye to Sister Christiansen was so sad, we've had so many amazing experiences together over the last 4 months. I am so grateful I had to chance to serve with her! From Stevens Point I was taken to Oshkosh with the other transferring missionaries and a few sisters who were going home the next day! It was fun to see Sister Bennet, she served in Adams-Friendship and was in my District during my first transfer, again! She's home now! Then we were divided up according to where we were going and then I was taken to Madison!<br/><br/>Mad Town:<br/>Madison is completely different from Wisconsin Rapids, but I love it! It was so weird to go from a little conservative town to a huge liberal city! Madison has such a 'college town' feel and rightfully so because the University of Wisconsin - Madison is right here! There are so many young people it's awesome! We talk with people all the time because there are so many college students out and about! Our ward is primarily made up of young couples and families studying at UW. At church on Sunday there were probably half a dozen young pregnant women walking around - so cute! The Mad 1 Ward is a lot bigger than the ward in Wisconsin Rapids. I think there are 4 wards in Madison total plus the campus YSA wards. There are 8 missionaries assigned just to our ward. 4 Spanish Elders, 2 English Elders, and us - the English Sisters! Oh another huge difference is the fact that Madison is a bussing area which means we don't have a car! Ha we get to use the busses to get around which is nice because it gives us loads of opportunities to talk with people!<br/><br/>The Glove Story:<br/>I love finding on the bus! It is so much better than tracting! Plus you meet all kinds of people on the bus so it is just fun(: Last night we were on the bus when these drunk guys got on - they were SO out of it! This guy told us a story about how his French girlfriend had special gloves she used when she smoked. He said my gloves looked like good smoking gloves.. ha then his buddy was laughing super hard and kept asking him to, "tell the glove story again!" Ha Sister King and I were laughing so hard! These poor guys were soo drunk and had no clue what was going on or what they were doing. I don't know why anyone would want to be so out of it like that! I am so grateful for the Word of Wisdom - it was totally given for our benefit!<br/><br/>Sister King:<br/>I was really worried about leaving Sister Christiansen right before the holidays! We had insane comp unity and taught well together, BUT Heavenly Father totally blessed me and I am so excited to serve with Sister King! She is amazing! She's from Provo and she went to BYU before coming out on her mission in January. She was actually in the MTC at the same time as Sister Christiansen so she has been out for 11.5 months. She's served in a bussing area her whole mission - one in Milwaukee and now in Madison! She loves sports and is super easy going, we get along really well! This is going to be a great transfer!(:<br/><br/>Hope you all have an awesome Thanksgiving this week and eat loads of turkey(: Thanks for all the letters, emails, and prayers! Love you guys!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>Transfer Trade Up (New Madison Address Coming Soon!)</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-1494616731189116490" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/>
<br/>
Man the last few days have been crazy! We got the "transfer text" (which is just a text they send out to everyone in the zone about who is being transferred) on Saturday morning. Sister Christiansen has been here in WI Rapids for 10.5 months now so we were pretty sure she would leave or we would both stay. To our surprise we read the text and found out that I AM LEAVING! I was sooo heartbroken! I have come to love the people here so much and really didn't want to leave right before the holidays! All week I had prayed that the right thing would happen with transfers so that I could learn and grow in order to become the missionary and person Heavenly Father wants me to become. I'm sad that my time here in Rapids is up, but I am so grateful for a loving Heavenly Father who is so mindful of me and is giving me this chance to learn and grow in MADISON! Yup that's right, I'm headed to Madison to serve with Sister King who I've heard great things about(: Can't wait for this next adventure!<br/>
<br/>
Learning from Lot's Wife:<br/>
I was studying in the Old Testament about Lot and the story of what happened to Lot's wife. Remember that one? She looks back on the wicked city of Sodom and Gomorrah and turns to a pillar of salt! It is so sad that she didn't have enough faith to trust Heavenly Father and leave her old life behind! There's an awesome Mormon Message called "Look Not Behind Thee" that we shared with a few families this week. I totally recommend it! It talks about how we each experience difficult moments when we want to turn back like Lot's Wife. It is in those difficult moments we need to have faith that what is ahead of us will be just as good if not better than what we are leaving behind. Heavenly Father knows what is best and what we need, we just have to have enough faith to trust Him and let Him guide our lives. I love the promise in Helaman 12:1 "the Lord in His infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in Him." I know as we put our trust in Him, He WILL bless us! <br/>
<br/>
Trying to Keep Warm:<br/>
The Flinders family have been letting us come over this week to exercise. It has been so nice! They have a couple treadmills and loads of weights! I have absolutely loved it! Sister Christiansen hasn't been able to workout much because of her ankle, but when we go to the Flinders she can walk on the treadmill or lift weights while I run! Oh how I've missed running! It is nice to start the day with a good workout and warm up because outside it's freezing! Seriously though.. it is starting to get sooo cold here. Everyone says it's way colder than normal already and they're anticipating a rough winter... yikes! We layer up hard core!<br/>
<br/>
District Meeting all about Families:<br/>
We had a DM all about the Family Proclamation this week! It was awesome! We discussed the roles of mothers and fathers and how they help one another. We talked about good parent examples in the Book of Mormon and shared things our parents had taught us. My favorite line in the Family Proclamation is, "Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ." It is so true. When we center our families around Christ we will experience peace and happiness! I am so grateful for how the gospel has blessed my family!<br/>
<br/>
LOL:<br/>
I don't know if I've ever mentioned this before, but Sister Christiansen and I laugh SO much! Ha her laugh is so contagious and when you get her going it takes a few minutes to calm her down! Ha this week we spent loads of time laughing! I'll attempt to explain one funny thing that happened, but it's probably a 'you had to be there' experience.. Ha but enjoy. So we were visiting April, one of our investigators, this week and her 10 year old daughter Grace asked if she could give us makeovers. We let her go at it and by the time we were finished we were covered in purple and blue sparkly eye-shadow and little barrettes! Ha we looked like super creepy clowns! Then we tried to share a message and we just couldn't stop laughing because we both looked so ridiculous! We probably laughed for like 10 minutes straight...(:<br/>
<br/>
Our Oath:<br/>
We were out and about when we felt a prompting to go contact a potential investigator. We knocked on her door and someone looked through the window, but didn't answer. UGHHHH. It was snowing and dark, but we could see someone across the street walking their dog. Cold and disappointed that our potential hadn't answered the door, we headed back to the car. As we walked away we realized we were totally wasting this opportunity to talk to the person outside walking their dog so we went back, but they were gone! We tracted around the area with no luck. Disappointed in ourselves at our failure to talk to everyone and anyone - we made an oath to talk to everyone we possibly could after that! The next day we were walking from one appointment to another and we saw a guy walking his dogs. This time we were ready! We stopped and talked with him which was great!<br/>
<br/>
Saying Goodbye:<br/>
I'm really excited to serve in Madison, but I will miss Wisconsin Rapids! If someone would've told me when I got here that I would be sad to leave, I never would've believed them! Ha but I have grown to truly love the people I've met here! I've been so blessed to get to know so many amazing people and to be influenced by their testimonies and good examples. I love how the gospel brings people together and allows us to learn and grow with each other! <br/>
<br/>
Well I think that's about it! I'll write to you next week from Madison! Stay warm, love you guys!<br/>
xoxo<br/>

</div><h1>P-day Again?</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-2925995944231638287" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>Another week has come and gone here in good ol' Wisconsin Rapids! Yesterday we woke up to snow on the ground again so we listened to Christmas Hymns while driving to church(: I'm getting a little scared for the winter out here because I'm already freezing to death... Ha the dang wind is bone chilling!<br/><br/>Exchanges in Wausau:<br/>This week I went on exchanges in Wausau with Sister Jardine! Sister Anderson, the new Sister Training Leader (STL), came to Rapids with Sister Christiansen. It was fun to go to Wausau again and spend time with Sister Jardine. She's an amazing missionary who teaches boldly and simply. I always learn a ton from her. On Tuesday morning we bundled up and went on a sweet hill run, but when we came back we were locked out of the apartment... Ha so that was an adventure! Thankfully the Hmong Elders live nearby and we were able to enlist their help in breaking in! It all worked out, we got on with our day and saw some awesome miracles! We taught a lady named Nancy who I actually met the last time I was in Wausau on exchanges. It was cool to see how much her testimony has grown since then and to realize how far I've come since then as well! Sisters Anderson and Christiansen found a new investigator and had some cool lessons as well! Exchanges are always a good time(:<br/><br/>Wausau Zone Conference in Gresham:<br/>The Adams-Friendship Sisters slept over Tuesday night so we could all drive together to Gresham Wednesday morning, so that was fun! It was good to see everyone in the zone again and we had a great Zone Conference all about the Book of Mormon! Teaching from the Book of Mormon is powerful. I am so grateful for the Book of Mormon and the focused study we are doing as a mission. We had a chance to share what stood out to us with our districts and I learned a ton! I really like Mosiah 27:25-26 realizing that the Atonement of Jesus Christ changes us! We can become so much more through Christ! I am so grateful for my Savior.<br/><br/>Working with the Youth:<br/>A few of the young women in the ward really want to serve missions so they had an activity this week introducing them to Preach My Gospel and talking about missionary life. They asked Sister Christiansen and I to come in and share with them what we did to prepare for our missions or what we wished we would have done and what a typical missionary day is like. We advised them to read the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon, and to start studying Preach My Gospel. The most important thing they can do, or any of us can do really, is to take Elder Anderson's advice from the recent General Conference and realize that, "Now is the time to adjust your own spiritual oxygen mask so that you are prepared to help others who are seeking truth." As we strengthen our own testimonies we will be more capable of helping others strengthen theirs. It was really fun to spend time with the young women - they are so strong! Being a member of the church out here is HARD! They are good examples to their friends and will be incredible missionaries. On Sunday we got to spend more time with the youth when we were asked to teach Sunday school! We had a good discussion about how we find answers and spent some time searching for answers together in the scriptures. Speaking of working with the youth.. Ha we are teaching two teenage boys, Ethan and Harley. They are both super great! Harley doesn't have any religious background at all, but we taught him that he has a loving Heavenly Father and this week he prayed for the first time!!! I am so grateful that we can pray to Heavenly Father and that He is so mindful of us!<br/><br/>Carol's Answer:<br/>This week we were finally able to set a baptismal date with our investigator Carol! I have such a sincere love for this woman - it's crazy! She has been through a lot in her life, but the gospel has truly changed her and given her so much strength! She's been investigating for a while, but her living situation was keeping her from progressing to baptism. This week Carol prayed and asked Heavenly Father what he wanted her to do and what direction she should go in her life. She told us that she immediately thought about moving out so she wouldn't be living with Tim anymore. We were so glad she recognized this answer to her prayer. She filed out a few housing applications, but there are long waiting lists. We are praying she will be able to get into the right place at the right time - this is all on the Lord's timetable! But we have faith that it is possible and that Carol is ready for this next step. We are excited for her to continue to learn and grow, she's great! She even invited a friend to come to church with her this Sunday! She introduced us to her friend Wendy who didn't seem interested at first, but once we started talking with her she lightened up and we were able to give her a copy of the Book of Mormon - Carol is already doing missionary work!<br/><br/>Day at the Doctors:<br/>Poor Sister Christiansen had to get a steroid shot in her foot this week to help reduce the pain caused by her plantar faciitis. The needle was GIGANTIC and it seemed super painful... Dr. Torhorst was super nice though and I got to watch the nurse take X-rays of Sister C's ankle which was cool. I think that kind of stuff is super interesting, but I don't know if I could give someone a shot.. <br/><br/>Recognizing Promptings:<br/>We were out trying to contact referrals on Saturday night when the name of a less active in the ward kept popping into my mind. I've been trying to become better at recognizing promptings so I told Sister C that Al's name kept coming to mind. We decided to stop in and see if Al was home, but it seemed pretty unlikely. We've gone to visit this lady half a dozen times and we've never been able to get in. Sister Christiansen has been here for 10 months and has only been able to get in once! So we decided to go visit Al and SHE WAS HOME! She let us in and we had a really good discussion about the Plan of Salvation. Her 16 year-old daughter Haley was also there so we got to know her and when we were sharing the message she was definitely touched. I was super grateful for the prompting I'd received to go see them and that I had been able to recognize it!<br/><br/>Well I think that's about all I've got for ya! Hope you guys are all doing well and staying healthy! Thanks for all the support and encouragement! Love you guys!<br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>Happy Halloween!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-2505474244403446841" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/>
<br/>
Well it's been another week. Ha I'm not sure where the time is going, but as of yesterday I've officially been out for 4 months! Can you believe it?! Man time is flying by out here!<br/>
<br/>
Carving Pumpkins:<br/>
Last P-day after emails we wanted to get into the spirit of Halloween so we decided to carve pumpkins with the Elders! Sister Christiansen carved a Harry Potter pumpkin which turned out great then I scraped out the pumpkin guts while Elder Neville carved what was supposed to be a one-eyed monster... it looked terrible! Ha epic fail. We all had a good time though(: Then we did some service raking and bagging leaves. We had a blast jumping in the piles of leaves and enjoying the fall weather!<br/>
<br/>
Painting, painting, and more painting:<br/>
I don't know what it is with us and painting lately, but we've been doing a ton of it for less actives, members, and investigators! Ha this week Sister Stoflet, our ward Relief Society President, needed help painting her house so we spent some time over there helping out. They've been working really hard to get their new house all finished before the snow flies! Hopefully they can start getting things moved in soon! <br/>
<br/>
Halloween Festivities:<br/>
On Halloween morning we woke up to snow! It was really pretty, but I'm not ready for it to be that cold quite yet! Thankfully most of it melted before the end of the day. We shared a message with our investigator April and got to see her girls get all dressed up to go out trick-or-treating! We enjoyed a delicious dinner at Sister Bauer's house with the Elders then played a few minute-to-win-it games where we all looked like complete fools. I'd say it was a successful Halloween for sure(:<br/>
<br/>
Ward Fall Festival:<br/>
Instead of a ward Halloween party they do a ward Fall Festival so that was held on November 1st! I was bummed the little kids didn't come in their cute costumes, but we had a good turn out and there were lots of fun activities. During the week we ran around like crazy visiting all of our investigators, less actives, and recent converts to invite them to the activity! It was great to see some of them there and introduce them to other members of the ward. Oh and they did the classic 'Chili Cook-off' so that was fun! The missionaries were the judges so Elders Kirk and Neville and Sister Christiansen and I had to taste test all the Chili and pick the winners! There was a Chili made with ghost peppers that absolutely killed my throat.. ha it was soo spicy! Also people in Wisconsin sometimes put noodles in their chili so that was weird... hadn't seen that before. Anyway it was a super fun activity(:<br/>
<br/>
Catholic Mass:<br/>
The Elders were invited to attend Catholic Mass by a lady who they met while out street contacting. They gave her a Book of Mormon and taught her the Restoration, but she is very Catholic. She asked why our church didn't have sister missionaries and they told her that the church actually does have sister missionaries.. so they brought us along to meet her during Saturday morning Mass. So yes, I went to a Catholic Mass this week! Ha it was actually really interesting, but weird too. You couldn't feel the spirit like you can in our church services. They were celebrating All Saints Day. Ha some of the stuff they did/said made sense, but then you could see where the truth had been lost. I am so grateful for the Restoration! We ended up going out to breakfast with this lady and had a great conversation about what we believe. We talked about the Great Apostasy a ton and bore testimony of the Book of Mormon. She said she would be interested in coming to one of our Sunday services to see how we worship so we'll see what comes of that!<br/>
<br/>
The Church is True:<br/>
I'm not sure if it was just the contrast between Mass the day before or the fact that we had 4 investigators attend Sacrament meeting(:(:(:... but I felt the spirit SO strongly at church this week!!! Sister Christiansen bore a really powerful testimony and I had a super cool fasting experience. I am so grateful for the Restoration of the gospel and the knowledge we have of the truth! I'm grateful for the power of the Holy Ghost and the fact that we can receive our own personal witness of the truth. The gospel requires ACTION and as we act our testimonies will increase in strength and we will become truly converted! <br/>
<br/>
Understanding Testimony:<br/>
Dylan, Jenny and Gary's son, is an 11 year old recent convert who I absolutely adore! He totally reminds me of my little brothers(: He is seriously the sweetest kid and has a heart of gold! He is such a good example to me - I learn so much from him. This week in preparation for Fast and Testimony meeting we talked with Dylan about bearing a testimony. He was nervous about it and wanted to practice in a Family Home Evening setting. Even in FHE he was scared, but he bore his testimony and did great! As a missionary I go around bearing my testimony to people everyday, but just like Dylan sometimes I get scared! Ha but the more I do it the easier it gets. In my Book of Mormon reading this week I read from Mosiah about Abinadi bearing his testimony so boldly and powerfully to wicked King Noah and his Priests. The power of his testimony touched Alma who then touched THOUSANDS of lives by bringing others to the knowledge of the truth. Bearing testimony is powerful! I am grateful for the chance I have to share my testimony each day with the people of Wisconsin(: Being a missionary rules!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the prayers, support, and encouragement! It means a lot(: I love and miss ya all! Hope you have a great week!<br/>
<br/>

</div><h1>Mahonri Moriancumerry Christmas to all! And to all a good Lamanite!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-990368540726222094" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Fam,<br/>Aww man talking with you guys on Christmas was the best! I'm so glad you're all doing well and kickin it up at the cabin(: Go snowmobiling a bunch for me because there is still no snow here... and I just miss it!<br/><br/>Pre-Christmas:<br/>Not going to lie, I definitely felt homesick this week. There were a couple hard days, but we made it through. I am so grateful for the members here in Madison - they take such good care of the missionaries! Last P-day Emily took us to drive through a big Christmas light show which was really fun. Then the Hunsaker family had all 8 missionaries in the ward over for dinner on the 23rd. Sister Hunsaker made some really good Thai food. It was fun to try somtum with sticky rice! During the day on the 23rd we had Zone Training Meeting. It was fun to get to know the Madison West Zone and share testimony/get pumped about the new year. We also went caroling with the Elders to this cute Nepali family they are teaching. We tried some good Nepali food and had fun talking with them about Christmas. Later we did a bit of street contacting up on Capitol square. Lots of people were out and about which made for an eventful street contacting sesh(:<br/><br/>Christmas Eve:<br/>On Christmas Eve we had dinner with the Feriante family! Sister Feriante is from Wales - so she made a traditional Welsh dinner and it was soo good! She even made Yorkshirepuddings like Grandma!!! Later that night we had a PJ party with Rachel, a recent convert who used to be Jewish so this was her first year celebrating CHRISTmas! Spending Christmas Eve with Rachel and her family was such a neat opportunity. Rachel has such a strong testimony about the Atonement. We had a really good lesson all about the Savior then frosted cookies and played games! Such a fun Christmas Eve!<br/><br/>Christmas Day:<br/>On Christmas day we still had studies and everything like normal then had lunch with the Gardner family who totally remind me of Ty and Bri! Their little girl Elsa is the sweetest! Later we got to FaceTime home from Emily's computer. It was so fun to see your cute faces again!!!! Haha just 5 more months and we'll get to do it again(: After FaceTiming we had a big dinner with a few families in the ward and a little White Elephant game. I am so grateful for the wonderful gift of our Savior and the chance we have to celebrate Him and His life!<br/><br/>Post Christmas:<br/>The day after Christmas I was exhausted! Ha I just really needed a nap, but just had to keep going with missionary work! We had some great lessons through the end of the week and spent time finding and contacting like usual. Deserae, a less active we've been working with, invited us over to make baby gingerbread houses which was fun. She also knitted us these cute little half-mittens! We were very well taken care of this Christmas. Thanks for all the letters, packages, and prayers - they all helped make being away from home a little easier(:<br/><br/>Transfers:<br/>This week is transfers! Sister King and I will be staying together here in Madison which we are both super excited about(: Our District will change a lot because all 3 elder companionships are changing! Elders Gifford, Humble, and Powell will be missed! Sister Christiansen, my trainer, is finally getting transferred out of Wisconsin Rapids after serving there for a couple weeks shy of 1 year! She is being transferred to Madison 2 where she will be serving as an STL (Sister Training Leader) this means we will get to go on exchanges together! Ahh so exciting!<br/><br/>Christmas as a Missionary:<br/>Spending Christmas as a missionary was such an amazing experience. I am so grateful for Christmas and the time we have to celebrate the birth and life of our Savior. I loved being able to share that message full time this year! We shared a Christmas message everywhere we went, but one of my favorites was reading 2 Nephi 18:6 and talking about the names of Christ. We can have a personal relationship with Christ! He is the King of Kings, Light of the World, Redeemer, Son of God, Messiah, Good Shepherd, Prince of Peace, OUR SAVIOR! Pick your favorite name of Christ and work on developing a closer relationship with Him this coming year.<br/><br/>Well we've gotta go, but thanks for all the support and encouragement! Love and miss you lots! Enjoy winter break(:<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>Merry Christmas!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-4369543752639051854" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hello Family!<br/><br/>It's crazy to think I'll be talking to you in a few days - yay for Christmas(: Even though I have been missing you all terribly, I am so grateful for the chance I have to spend Christmas as a missionary sharing my testimony of the Savior with the people in Madison everyday!<br/><br/>District White Elephant:<br/>The transfer text comes next Saturday and then transfers will be the following Wednesday so this week we had our last District Meeting together! A few of the Elders have been here in Madison for over 6 months so they are pretty sure they will be transferred, but Sister King and I really hope to stay together! I love the Madison district and was grateful we had the chance to share our testimonies one last time(: I have learned so much from the Elders and Sisters I've served around! We finished District Meeting with a game of White Elephant - ha it was so fun!<br/><br/>Recognizing Promptings:<br/>We taught Emily again this week, but this time her identical twin sister was visiting so she sat in on the lesson too! Emily's family was really against the church when she joined so Sister King and I were a bit nervous to see how the lesson would go. We shared a message about the importance of following the prophet. We shared a few verses from the Book of Mormon and I just had the strongest impression we needed to give Rachel (Emily's sister) her own copy. At the end of the lesson I asked if she'd like a BOM and she accepted gratefully and later told Emily she was impressed with how we taught and wants to read the Book of Mormon! It was such a huge tender mercy that the lesson went so well and her heart was softened!<br/><br/>Baptismal Date:<br/>Ishmeal now has a baptismal date! Ahh! We are so excited for him - he is so sincere and really wants to get closer to his Heavenly Father. We had a great lesson with him about the Plan of Salvation. We focused on how the Plan of Salvation wouldn't be possible without Christ and how the Atonement is soo central. A few days after setting the baptismal date, Ishmeal was able to come to a baptism of someone the campus elders have been teaching! The baptismal service was done mostly in Chinese because the man getting baptized is from China going to school here, but even though Ishmeal didn't understand everything that was said he totally felt the spirit and got a little emotional toward the end! He is excited for his baptism and is doing so well(:<br/><br/>Pre-Christmas Christmas:<br/>This week we celebrated Christmas with the Thurston family before they went back home to Utah to celebrate the holidays with their families. We ate good food, decorated sugar cookies, hung stockings, and sang Christmas carols! It was super fun! They are so good to help out the missionaries and are always so willing to come to lessons with us - we are so grateful for them and all the awesome Madison 1st Ward members! We are being very well taken care of for Christmas - we are planning on spending Christmas Eve with a recent convert who used to be Jewish so this is her first Christmas celebrating Christ so it is gonna be sweet!<br/><br/>Talk to you in a few days!!! Hope you have a very Merry Christmas, take some time to read the Christmas story and reflect on the incredible gift of our Savior. He truly is the gift, our gift. I love Him and am grateful for his infinite atoning sacrifice - through Him we can become better! Merry Christmas - love you!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley<div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
Dear Family and Friends,</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br/></div>
Hey! How are you guys doing?! Getting ready for Christmas? I love this time of year and am so grateful for all the miracles we've been seeing! Seems like people's hearts are softened by the Christmas spirit of Christ-like love(: Aside from talking to everyone and anyone we can about Christmas and our Savior, we have spent all week getting ready for Kendall's baptism! Everything turned out beautifully(:<br/><br/>Soccer:<br/>This week we joined some of the Hispanic members in the ward to play soccer in the gym at the church! It was so much fun to get to know the Spanish speaking members better - they're great! I love that the Madison 1st Ward has so many Spanish speaking members - we have translators/headsets for Sacrament meeting and one of the Sacrament prayers is always said in Spanish! So cool.<br/><br/>Exchanges in Mad 2:<br/>I got to go on exchanges in the Madison 2nd ward with Sister Ostler! It was fun to be companions with her for the day after having served together in the Adams District before we were both transferred to Madison! Sister Ostler is a hard worker and is really in tune with the spirit. We had a busy day of service, finding, and teaching. The highlight of the exchange was going out with Sister Goue, a member in the Mad 2 ward. She invited us to come with her to talk to her neighbor about the church. We weren't quite sure what to expect, but we had an amazing lesson with a Mr. Nunez where the spirit was definitely felt! We testified boldly of forever families and how it's possible through Jesus Christ. Ahh I love the gospel!<br/><br/>Kendall:<br/>AHH I cannot say enough about the amazing person that Kendall is! I absolutely love her and am so grateful for her example! She has soo much faith and is so Christ-like. She has always had a good relationship with her Father in Heaven, but joining the church is just going to help her to come even closer to Him! It has been such a privilege to teach her, I feel so blessed to have been a small part of her conversion. She is our Christmas miracle! Everything for Kendall's baptism turned out perfectly - the music, program, flowers, filling the font, setting up chairs, unlocking the building, everything! It all turned out and Kendall's family came to support her even though they've been struggling a bit with her decision. After the ordinance she bore a simple, powerful testimony and said a beautiful sincere prayer. Her confirmation was done in church on Sunday, the same day as the Christmas program! The spirit was so strong in that Sacrament meeting and Kendall was just beaming(:<br/><br/>He Is the Gift:<br/>I hope you have all watched the 'He Is the Gift' video that was put out by the church - if not you better look it up right now! It is SO good. We have been giving out pass along cards about it to EVERYONE! I really am so grateful for a loving Heavenly Father who gave us the gift of His Beloved son. Because of Him I can become better and be forgiven of my weaknesses. Because of Him I can live with my family forever! I am so grateful for my Savior and this time of year to celebrate his birth and life!<br/><br/>So I think that's about it other than we've been experiencing a bit of a heat wave here in Madison.. meaning it's been 30-40 degrees instead of like 10 degrees. Ha so yay for that! It's actually a bit sad because all the snow has melted! I hope there is a big storm next week so we'll have a nice white Christmas(: Is there snow at home? Either way you guys will have a white Christmas up at the cabin! I can't believe Christmas is right around the corner! I'm excited to Skype with you soon(: Love and miss you!<div>
<br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:</div>

</div><h1>Waking Up On The Right Side Of The Bed</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-8585418527268731273" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>So this week was jam packed with miracles!!! During the week amazing things would happen and Sister King and I would look at each other and just be blown away by how obvious the Lord's hand is in this work! I am just so grateful to be serving as a missionary - it is such a privilege!<br/><br/>Kendall:<br/>The phrase, "waking up on the right side of the bed" took on a whole new meaning for me when we got a text message from our investigator Kendall on Tuesday morning! She texted us asking when the soonest was that she could be baptized! AHH!!! Needless to say we were freaking out! We were so excited! We called and she explained that she'd been praying a lot the night before and she woke up and just KNEW she had to be baptized! Ha so after that our week was devoted to teaching Kendall, cleaning the baptismal font, and figuring out the baptism details! It isn't everyday your investigator texts you asking to be baptized! Ha this was such a miracle especially considering the fact that when the sisters had invited her to be baptized a few weeks ago she had freaked out and felt like it was too soon! She is so prepared now that she's mustered up the faith to do it and got her answer she knows it's right! Kendall is such an incredible example to me - she doesn't have a lot of family/friend support on this, but she knows it is right and she just wants to help her relationship with her Father in Heaven grow! She was experiencing a lot of opposition from her family a few days after deciding to be baptized, but we had a really powerful lesson with her that helped. Right when we got there we could just tell how overwhelmed she felt, but as soon as we said the opening prayer the spirit was there so strongly! I felt Heavenly Father's love for her pour into the room and after that everything started falling into place. I am so excited for Kendall - she'll be baptized this Saturday!<br/><br/>Success on the Bus:<br/>There are only three Sister areas in the mission that are strictly bussing areas and we are SO lucky to be one of them! Well sometimes when we run late and have to chase after the bus we don't feel so lucky.. ha or when it takes forever to get us somewhere.. but really the bus is such a great finding tool! We talk with tons of people and this week we were blessed to see success come from opening our mouths! We met Liliana, this cute lady from Columbia while we were waiting at the bus stop and we got talking with her and invited her to the ward Christmas party - she totally came and had a great time! On Sunday, Nate, a guy we met on the bus a couple weeks ago randomly came to church - huge miracle! The Elders talked lots with him so that was cool. One night we had a few minutes to wait at a transfer point for our connecting bus so we scouted around for someone we could give a copy of the Book of Mormon to. Sister King and I both felt impressed to talk with this woman so we went up and started a conversation with her, but she didn't speak English! We both knew a tiny bit of Spanish from school so Sister King and I did our best to communicate with her. It went surprisingly well and before our bus came we had told her where our church building was, invited her to the ward Christmas party, and testified of how the gospel blesses families! We gave Latisia's information to the Spanish Elders so hopefully they will be able to teach her! The final bus success story of the week is with Ishmeal - he is just SO prepared! We had a lesson with him at the church this week about the Restoration. He totally accepted everything we shared and was so glad we believed that miracles continue to happen! He asked lots of good questions and at the end of the lesson we extended a soft baptismal date and he said baptism is something he wants to work towards! He came to the Ward Christmas Party and totally love it - he came early to help set up and stayed after to clean up. Ahh we just feel like Heavenly Father is putting people in our path!<br/><br/>Ward Christmas Party:<br/>The Madison 1st Ward Christmas party was a blast! We helped set up chairs and tables for it on Saturday morning and made chocolate chip cookies to contribute to the potluck dessert. Everything turned out really well - the activities committee did a great job! There was a fun program and tons of people came. We had a few investigators show up and a lady we met on the bus came and talked with the Spanish Elders!<br/><br/>Christmas Devotional:<br/>On Sunday night the Seniors, a nice family in the ward, invited all 8 Madison 1st Ward missionaries over for break the fast! It was fun to eat all together and afterwards we watched the First Presidency Christmas Devotional! The devotional was really good - I definitely recommend looking it up if you didn't get a chance to watch it! Elder Christofferson's talk was really good. I liked how they emphasized that the spirit of Christmas is Christ-like love!<br/><br/>Hope you are all getting ready for Christmas(: Take some time to remember the reason for the season - I am so grateful for my Savior Jesus Christ and all that he has done for each one of us. Hope you have a good week - I love and miss you all so much!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>Happy Thanksgiving!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7995488539939255412" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>It sounds like you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving break! I missed spending the holiday with you, but am so grateful to be serving as a missionary here in Madison(:<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Dinner x2:<br/>The ward members took such good care of us this week! We were invited to TWO Thanksgiving dinners! We ate the first with the Thirsten's, a young family here for Grad school, and the second with the Durtschi's, a nice family in the ward who invited a bunch of ward members, less actives, and the missionaries over to enjoy the big meal. We enjoyed all the traditional Thanksgiving specialties, but also tried a few German dishes! I'm not a huge sweet potato fan, but Brother Durtschi made them taste pretty dang good! I also loved the rolls and Sister Thirsten's apple pie(: While walking over to the Thirsten's Sister King and I had fun counting our blessings - we truly have been given SO much! During comp study we found D&amp;C 78:19 which rules!!! Look it up! I am just so grateful for the gospel and this time I have to share it full time!<br/><br/>Best Lessons of the Week:<br/>This week we met with Emily, a less active Mom who wants to come back to church - we are just going through all of  the missionary discussions to help her strengthen her testimony. This week we had a great lesson about the Plan of Salvation where we used the classic little pictures to help illustrate each part of the plan. We taught about pre-mortal life, living on earth, the spirit world, resurrection, judgment, and the 3 kingdoms of glory, but then we talked about our Savior Jesus Christ and how the entire plan is centered on Him. Without Him it would all end at death - as we explained this we took away all of the pictures past that point and it just really illustrated how much we rely on our Savior and His Atonement. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it was super powerful! I know we need Christ in our lives and I am so grateful for Him and His infinite Atonement!<br/>Another great lesson was with Nazeleh, an 18 year old potential investigator the Elders found a few months ago. We met her family last week and were able to catch her at home this week! We shared a message with her about the Book of Mormon and explained where it came from and why it is so important. She listened intently and asked some really good questions! When we asked if she wanted to learn more she said that she did, but that she also wanted her family to sit in on our next lesson because she thought they would really like it and that her Mom had been impressed with us when she met us last week! Sister King and I are so excited to have a family to teach!(:<br/><br/>Bus Contacting Success:<br/>I am a huge fan of bus contacting! We just talk with everyone and anyone on the bus. This week some people really didn't want to talk with us and just ignored us, but then we met some other people who were totally prepared! We made a goal to testify boldly of Jesus Christ and to try to pass out more copies of the Book of Mormon so with that in mind we just went to work talking with everyone! We met a man named Ishmael on the bus and invited him to church just like we do with everyone else we talk to, but on Sunday he actually showed up to church! It was awesome! He stayed for all 3 hours and really enjoyed it! We have an appointment with him later this week so hopefully that goes well! It was such a huge blessing/answer to prayers to have 5 investigators at church this week!<br/><br/>Hiccups:<br/>So I got a really bad case of the hiccups on Sunday after church and they just wouldn't go away! We were in a lesson with Janet, this cute old lady recent convert, and she told me to hold my breath while she counted to 10 to get my hiccups to go away. I did and afterwards they were gone! I thanked her for curing me and then she humbly said, "no it was God who cured you." Ha Sister King and I both stifled some laughter, but later we talked about what a great example Janet is to us! She totally attributes every good thing that happens to her to be from Heavenly Father! She is so grateful for all the little things and we should be too! I love Alma 26:12 where Ammon accepts his own weaknesses and just glories in God. I've been thinking a lot about how I can be better at acknowledging God's hand because this is His work and we see so many little miracles each day! I am grateful for a loving Heavenly Father who is so mindful of us!<br/><br/>Alright I think that about sums up the week! Things are going well here as we're gearing up for Christmas!

</div><h1>Ishmael's Baptism</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-3898022630764625625" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>Seems like I just wrote home two seconds ago... ha this week flew by! We met with Ishmael a lot and were busy planning the baptism, but we also spent quite a bit of time contacting or at least attempted to. Ha we got off at the wrong bus stop a couple times and walked around in the cold till we figured out where to go, but we met some cool people and it all worked out in the end!<br/><br/>Daily Contact<br/>The week leading up to a baptism we try to have daily contact with the investigator so we spent a lot of time teaching Ishmael this week! It's been such a blessing to help him get ready for his baptism. He has such a sincere desire to obey the commandments and follow Jesus Christ. On Tuesday he passed his baptismal interview and stayed to listen to our discussion about effective study habits during district meeting. During the week he told us how much he loves reading about Captain Moroni in the Book of Mormon and shared with us his favorite verse, Alma 48:17. So solid. On Friday we had a lesson in a member's home and taught the importance of enduring to the end and that his baptism was just the first step he was taking to follow the Savior. Then everything came together smoothly and the baptism took place Saturday afternoon. Ishmael bore his testimony and thanked the ward for being there to support him. Yesterday he was confirmed and afterwards he was so happy!<br/><br/>Baptism: Our First Covenant<br/>Saturday night the Dimond family had all 4 sets of missionaries over for a huge waffle dinner - mmm it was soo good! It's always fun to spend time with the other missionaries, but with the Dimond family too?? It was the perfect end to a great day! The Dimond family is amazing! After the meal Sister King and I shared a message about baptism. They all loved the pictures we brought of us when we were baptized 11 years ago.. ha we passed them around and asked everyone to share something they remembered from their baptism. Though the responses varied, everyone talked about how they felt happy and at peace. Following the Savior brings true peace and happiness - I am so grateful I was baptized and that I have the chance to help others enter the gate that leads to eternal life! (2 Nephi 31:17-18)<br/><br/>Missing Gecko's<br/>This week we went to dinner with a not-so-recent recent convert in the ward, Shaun, and his daughter Sierra, who we might start teaching! We met at this little Mexican restaurant called La Hacienda. I was super excited since I LOVE Mexican food, but it was junky and just made me miss Gecko's a ton. What I wouldn't give for a bowl of Gecko's salsa and guacamole right about now. <br/><br/>Well I think that's about it. Shout out to Uncle Allen for getting engaged - ha that's sooo exciting! Love and miss you!<br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><h1>MLK Jr. Day and a Crowded Bus</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-6852119865570237385" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>Where to begin?! This week was full of miracles. Sister King and I were just running around like crazy trying to stay on top of things! Sorry we didn't get to email yesterday - the campus library was closed due to Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Since we couldn't email yesterday the zone got together at the institute building which was super fun! It was also a holiday bus schedule so the busses didn't run as frequently and when they did run they were PACKED! Riding back from the institute with the Elders was insane! We got on a bus with almost 100 people packed onto it!<br/><br/>Just Walking:<br/>Earlier in the week we were out doing some contacting when we felt prompted to go try to stop by to see Debra. We'd had an appointment scheduled with her for that day, but she had cancelled it because of a doctor's appointment for her little boy. We still felt like we should try to go see her though so we walked and walked and walked and then we ran into her on the street! It was such a tender mercy because we were able to talk with her and help with some of her concerns. It was one of those 'in the right place at the right time' moments and it felt so good!<br/><br/>Debra and Jada's Baptism:<br/>This Saturday everything fell into place and the English Elder's investigators, Debra and Jada, were baptized! We met with Debra and Jada a couple times to help teach lessons so it was fun to be a small part of their journey. It was such a tender mercy that everything worked out and came together - I wish I could explain all the mini miracles that we witnessed this week, but I don't have the time! Guess we'll save the full story for after the mission, but Jada (12 years old) is just the sweetest thing and after she was baptized she was just glowing!<br/><br/>Possibly the Most Spiritual Experience of My Mission Thus Far:<br/>Alright I have sat in on some very spirit filled lessons in the last 6 months, but this one takes the cake! AHHH it was incredible! We had a lesson with our recent convert Kendall as our 'member present' and we taught Ishmael our investigator who will be getting baptized THIS Saturday! It was a pretty simple lesson, we taught the importance of obedience and that keeping the commandments brings happiness. Then Kendall shared her testimony and her experience joining the church. Like Ishmael, she was raised Catholic so she related really well to him and helped answer some of his questions and concerns. She bore such a simple, powerful testimony the spirit filled the room SO strongly! It was such a sweet moment for Sister King and I to see Kendall teaching Ishmael things we taught her just a couple months ago. She has so much faith and is such a great example! Ishmael was really touched by her testimony and we had a few other great lessons with him this week. He passed his baptismal interview today and things are looking good for Saturday - we are so excited for him!(:<br/><br/>The Sacrament:<br/>Elder Don R. Clarke of the Seventy taught, “If we properly prepare for the sacrament, we can transform our lives.” My understanding of the Sacrament has grown SO much as a missionary. This week we had a cool lesson about the Sacrament with Emily and it made me so excited for church and the opportunity we have to partake of the Sacrament. It can truly be a spiritual experience for us! I am so grateful for the chance we have to renew our covenants each week and recommit ourselves to following the Savior.<br/><br/>Thanks for all the support and encouragement! I hope things are going well back home - love and miss you lots, but there is no where I'd rather be!<br/><br/>xoxo,<br/>Sister Kelley(:<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>-36 Degrees and Still Kickin!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7155743864065232506" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>This week has been great, just a little on the cold side! Ha we bundle up and do our best to stay warm. Thank goodness for heated busses!(:<br/><br/>P-day Adventure:<br/>So last P-day after emailing we helped out with a musical number for a memorial service. Our not-so-recent recent convert, Shaun, had a neighbor who passed away so we helped out with that. Everybody shared fond memories of Frank Churchill and Shaun sang some gospel music and 'We Need Thee Every Hour' it was a good time for sure. Nice service. Then after the memorial we were down on Capitol Sqaure so we just went exploring and tried to go to a free art museum, but it was closed! We did get a great picture out front though. We ended up checking out the Capitol building while trying to warm up - it was insanely cold that day!<br/><br/>Madison West Zone Training Meeting:<br/>It's always fun to get together with the zone, but this time around a few of the sister areas had been closed (due to the many sisters who finished their missions and went home these past few transfers) so that was a bummer! Now there are only 2 sets of sisters in our zone, us and Madison 4th ward. It's so sad! But ZTM was super good and I learned a ton! We talked about what it means to 'lay hold of every good thing' (Moroni 7:19). How we can each change and become like Christ through the Atonement (Moroni 7:20-23). I'm so grateful we have the chance to repent, make changes, and refine ourselves through Christ. His Atonement is all encompassing!<br/><br/>The First Vision:<br/>I've taught the Restoration a lot on my mission, but I've never felt the spirit as strongly as I did this week when we taught it to our investigator Jeanne. We were having a really good discussion and talking about the lesson points a lot, but when we shared Joseph Smith's account of the First Vision the spirit in the room totally changed and it got super quiet. I just bore my testimony and felt such a strong confirmation that the things I was sharing were true. I know Joseph Smith truly restored the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth again and I am so grateful for the chance I have to share this message here in Madison!<br/><br/>Fav Lessons of the Week:<br/>Here are a few high light lessons of the week..  We taught the English Elder's investigator Deborah and her 12-year-old daughter Jada about tithing and fasting. Even though Deborah's financial situation is a little tough she is so eager and willing to pay her tithing. She trusts God and wants to give back to show how grateful she is for all she has - ahh I was just so touched by her sincere testimony. Then her daughter Jada was asking some really good questions about fasting and is excited to fast for answers to specific questions. They are going to be baptized this coming week. Then we had a lesson with Shay and Amanda about prayer. We read Alma 37:36-37 and talked about how we can 'cry unto God for all thy support'. We are so blessed to have a loving Heavenly Father we can rely on and turn to! I know He hears and answers our prayers! Finally we had a lesson with Emily which we hadn't really had time to plan beforehand so we ended up just reading Moroni 7 together. We'd read a few verses and then talk about what we had read and what we were thinking/feeling. As we read from the Book of Mormon the spirit was there so strongly! Emily even said she received some direct answers about some things that have been on her mind for a while now. I am so grateful for the power of the Book of Mormon, that each time we read we can get something new out of it and that as we read Heavenly Father helps answer our questions and comfort our souls. <br/><br/>Exchanges with Sister C:<br/>On Friday night we went on exchanges with the Sister Training Leaders! Sister Christiansen got transferred to the Madison 2nd ward and is serving as an STL so we got to go on exchanges together! It was so fun to be with my trainer again - she is such an incredible missionary! We had fun catching up and chatting about Rapids(: Saturday was full of miracles - we gave out a copy of the Book of Mormon to a girl on the bus and had several other lessons with people on the street and at the bus stop. I navigated the busses successfully and managed to get us to and from all of our appointments on time! Ahh we had such a fun day together and I learned a lot on the exchange.<br/><br/>Ward Conference:<br/>Fun fact: we had ward conference yesterday! The Stake Leaders talked about service and how as we go about doing good and serving those around us, opportunists to invite people to learn more about the gospel will present themselves.<br/><br/>Well I think that about sums up our week! I hope you are all staying warm and having fun(: We have a busy week planned ahead of us so I am excited! Ishmael is doing great and getting excited for his baptism on January 24th, keep him in your prayers! Love and miss you!<br/><br/>xoxo,<br/>Sister Kelley(:<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>Aah can you believe it's 2015?! I am so excited for this New Year - I get to be a representative of Christ ALL YEAR LONG! How cool is that?! I hope you all had fun New Year's celebrations and are setting some goals to help you become closer to your Savior(:<br/><br/>SNOW!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>So good news, it FINALLY snowed! In my opinion Madison looks a whole lot prettier with a fresh layer of snow on the ground(: Unfortunately with the snow came the nasty freezing cold... ha today it was -8 when we left the apartment, so that's fun. Haha Sister King and I just bundle up and look like complete fools, but at least we're warm(:<br/><br/>Change Ups in the District:<br/>Exchanges happened this week so on Tuesday we said goodbye to Elders Gifford, Humble, and Powell. We all went out for lunch together at Buffalo Wild Wings - ha it was a blast! I love being in Madison where we are so close to so many other missionaries! I learn so much from their testimonies and examples. Then on New Years Eve the Durtschi's invited all the missionaries over for dinner so we got to meet the new Elders - Elders Hernandez, Marsh, and Sullivan. They all seem really nice. I am just SOO grateful Sister King and I get to stay together for another transfer! She is such a hard worker and has a strong testimony of the Savior. I learn so much from her everyday and we get along super well. Plus she is a boss at managing the bussing schedule so she keeps us out of the cold as much as possible which is a huge blessing! I am going to struggle navigating the area when she leaves!<br/><br/>Ether 12:4:<br/>This week we contacted a referral from Sister Durschi - she had met this lady at a card class she hosted and had given her a copy of the Book of Mormon. Turns out when we stopped by to talk to Jeanne, she had read the ENTIRE Book of Mormon in a matter of days. Hold on let's just appreciate this for a minute... SHE READ THE ENTIRE BOOK OF MORMON IN LIKE THREE DAYS! Ah we had a really good discussion with her about the Book of Mormon and she said she knows it is true because it is all about faith. Ether 12:4 popped into my mind so we shared it with her and she liked it so much she went to mark it in her copy of the BOM and that was right where her bookmarker was! She took that as a huge sign and wants to take the discussions now. So cool! Sister Durtschi invited her over for dinner on Wednesday and after we had a really good lesson - shared Moroni 10:3-5 and challenged her to pray and ask if this is true. I can't wait for our appointment this week!<br/><br/>WoW Down LoC to Go:<br/>We met with Ishmeal a few times this week to teach him more about the Book of Mormon, read with him, and teach the Word of Wisdom! He was having a hard time understanding the BOM in English so we had the Spanish Elders read with him in a member's home and that went really well. He seriously is SO prepared - I am so excited for him to be baptized in a few weeks! He agreed to live the Word of Wisdom and is already contributing so much to the ward! AH Ishmeal is awesome(:<br/><br/>Amanda:<br/>Our recent convert Shay introduced us to her friend Amanda this week and now we are going to start teaching her! The moment I met Amanda her face just seemed so familiar to me! It was crazy because I'd never seen her before, but then after Sister King told me she had felt the same way - ah so cool. Amanda is 19 and has been through a lot, but she has seen how the gospel has blessed Shay's life and that is what she wants! We had a great lesson with her about the Book of Mormon and how reading from it brings so much peace and happiness into our lives. I am really excited to start teaching her!<br/><br/>Happy 6 Months:<br/>This past week I hit my 6 month mark and that has caused me to have a bit of a 6 month crisis! Ha I have one year left on my mission and I want to work really hard and make the most of it! More than anything I want to become the missionary Heavenly Father wants me to become and prepare for the future! In setting some New Years Resolutions I reread Elder Holland's 'Remember Lot's Wife' talk that I have raved about before and the thing that stood out to me was just the fact that faith is always pointed toward the future. Because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ we can be changed, we can BECOME better, we can reach our divine potential if we just allow Christ's atonement to work in our lives. I'm far from perfect, but with Christ's help I can progress and become better - I am looking forward to the New Year and hope you are too!<br/><br/>There is a lot going on here in Madison, so much work to do! I am getting better at talking with people and teaching from the scriptures. I just learn so much each day and am grateful for this opportunity to learn and grow. Thanks for all the prayers and encouragement - it means the world and really helps me make it through hard days! Hope you all have a great week! Love you!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
Dear family and friends,</div>
<div>
<br/>So yeah, this week happened. Ha each day seems long, but the week seems super short! Things are going well though, still doing lots of finding! We are trying so hard to find people who will progress, people Heavenly Father is preparing! It takes faith and hard work, but we've seen so many miracles - being a missionary is the best(:<br/><br/>Touring Epic<br/>Loads of the people in the ward work for this big company called Epic - it's a huge computer company based here in Madison. Anyway last P-day the Cocke's (a family in the ward) took all the missionaries to tour it! It seems weird to go tour a bunch of office buildings, but these buildings are amazing - look them up! They are all decorated in themes - seriously so great. Wish I could've taken better pictures, but my camera died! Anyway just know it was cool. My favorite floor had fake grass and full size swings! It was wide open with big windows and space to sit and work with a laptop while imagining you were relaxing outside on a warm summer day(:<br/><br/>Right Place, Right Time<br/>Gotta love those moments when you are totally in the right place at the right time! We were on our way to a dinner appointment the other night struggling to find the right apartment complex when we saw a lady coming out of her apartment. We stopped and asked her for directions and she helped us figure out where to go - then we had the opportunity to share the gospel with her! She didn't speak a ton of English and I don't speak a ton of Spanish, but we were able to communicate with her and pray with her! Thank goodness Ishmael taught Sister King and I how to pray in Spanish! We gave her info to the Spanish Elders and hope they will be able to start teaching her!<br/><br/>Madison Zone Conference<br/>The Madison East and West Zones got together for Zone Conference on Tuesday - it is always so fun to see all of the other missionaries! Elders McDurmott and Baird who I came to the field with are serving in the Madison zones so it was fun to talk with both of them. I have now served around everyone I came out from the MTC with except Sister Escobar! We still write to each other and are hoping to be companions again one day(: I also got to see Sister Christiansen and Sister Ostler - they both gave a training about the importance of working with members. I love being able to see my trainer, she's such a great STL! Anyway Zone Conference was great, we talked about the Plan of Salvation and how it isn't possible without the Atonement. We practiced making the Atonement the central point when we teach as well as the principle of eternal families. President and Sister Cutler are incredible(:<br/><br/>Plan of (:<br/>We are taking the lead on teaching Debra and Jada's new member lessons so this week we taught the Plan of Salvation. We implemented the training we'd received at Zone Conference and the lesson went so well! The spirit was definitely there as we testified of the centricity of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. It was fun to see Jada answering questions about the Plan and looking up scriptures. Debra and Jada have come so far - love them!<br/><br/>Map Pro<br/>Alright I've got to admit I have never been good with a map.... but this week I got a ton better! Ha this whole navigating Madison on the busses and on foot thing is still hard, but I'm getting the hang of it slowly. Thank goodness for kind bus drivers who help point us in the right direction and help us get off at the right stops!<br/><br/>Finding<br/>More finding.... ha we spent time tracting in the cold, bus contacting on the crazy buses, and looking for opportunities to teach as we did service. While helping out at a local food pantry we met this woman named Diona who we were able to talk to and teach about eternal families - such a sweet experience. Then later while waiting at the transfer point to catch a connecting bus we ran into this kid named Darnell who we met and talked with a few weeks ago. He accepted a Book of Mormon when we talked to him this week and gave us his number! Finding is tough work, but we are seeing so many little miracles each day - I know Heavenly Father is directing this work!<br/><br/>Gigi's Baptism<br/>On Saturday there were 3 baptisms in the Mad 1 building! The Spanish Elders have been teaching Gigi and Richard and the campus elders have been teaching Gong Feng. Their baptisms all turned out beautifully. Sister Schlosser and I helped a lot with Gigi's - she is such a sweet lady! Thank goodness for Senora Denny and 9th grade Spanish classes, it was such a tender mercy I was able to remember enough Spanish to communicate with her!<br/><br/>Book of Mormon<br/>I thought I already had a strong testimony of the Book of Mormon, but everyday it just grows stronger and stronger! This week 3 Nephi 15:1 stood out to me about how it is important that we REMEMBER and DO the things we are taught. When we receive spiritual revelation and guidance we can't just think "oh that was nice" ha we need to remember the experience we had and then go out and do something about it! We had a cool lesson with Emily about this topic after I'd found it during my personal study. Ah how I love the scriptures!<br/><br/>Sorry this letter is a bit long... ha just know I'm having a good time out here and doing my best to be an instrument in God's hands! Oh I forgot to mention that Ishmael received the Aaronic Priesthood this week! He is doing so well! Anyway hope you all have a good week. Love and miss you! Hope you get the Beatles reference in the subject line - Sister Schlosser loves the Beatles and sings Blackbird all the time! I prefer 'Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey' ha but anything Beatles is good(:<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>Livin' on Prayer</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7557257912057852433" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear family and friends,<br/><br/>Taking over Madison has seriously been such a 'baptism by fire' type of experience. These last few days have been absolutely insane. Possibly some of the most trying and most rewarding moments of my mission thus far. I've definitely felt tried and stretched, but by turning to Heavenly Father in prayer I have been given the strength to keep moving forward. My faith and testimony of the Savior and the power of the Atonement have been strengthened ten fold this week! I truly have felt strengthened and sustained through prayer. We're only 4 days into this new transfer and I've already grown a ton! Can't wait to see what the Lord has in store for us here in Madison these next few weeks!<br/><br/>Goodbye Sister King:<br/>Aww man saying goodbye to Sister King was rough! We spent her last full day in Madison teaching lessons to Rachel, Janet, Sarah, and Emily. Kendall took us out for breakfast that morning at the Basset Brunch Club - aw man it was incredible! Then the Thurston's had us and the English Elders over for dinner. It's crazy to think Elder Harmon is home now! We had a powerful lesson with them talking about why we are grateful for the Savior. The spirit was so strong. In every lesson Sister King bore her testimony of Christ and coming to know Him through the Book of Mormon. She's an incredible missionary and has taught me so much these last two transfers! I'm grateful for the opportunity I had to serve with her(:<br/><br/>Transfer Point:<br/>Wednesday I spent all day at the Madison Stake Center waiting with other missionaries in the Madison Zones for our new companions to make the trip from the central transfer point in Oshkosh! We all went out to lunch at Subway after doing studies and having a little devotional. Sister Cosgrove and I stuck together - she's amazing! Then finally the new missionaries arrived and I got to meet Sister Schlosser! She just finished her training in Green Bay so she's been out for 3 months. She's 21, from Oregon, and is a pre-animation major at BYU! She's got the cutest curly red hair and is a really hard worker! Getting a new companion is always a transition and it took a few days to figure things out, but we are excited to see miracles happen in this area as we work together!<br/><br/>The Daily Grind:<br/>This week has been such an adventure navigating the busses! We've only missed one bus which I am pretty proud of. Ha so it is going decently well I would say! Sister Schlosser has been so patient with me! We've spent a lot of time out contacting and finding. We just really need new investigators who will progress! We got a couple new investigators after lots of prayer and hard work! We made passing out copies of the Book of Mormon a big focus this week and saw so many miracles from it!<br/><br/>Valentine's Day:<br/>Hope you all had a lovely Valentine's day - ha I know we sure did! We passed out a few copies of the Book of Mormon and ate KFC with a Janet, this cute old lady recent convert in the ward(: Remember last Valentine's day when I opened my mission call?! Crazy to think it's been a year and now here I am in Wisconsin absolutely loving it! Ha I've learned and grown a lot since then for sure!<br/><br/>Thanks for the Valentines and the homemade granola! I may or may not have eaten most of it already...(: I love and miss you - you're always in my prayers! Have a good week and enjoy President's day today! Go on an extra snowmobile loop at the cabin for me!<br/><br/><div>

Dear family and friends,<br/><br/>Seems like the longest - shortest week of my life. I swear we live in some kind of time warp. We did a lot of finding and had success getting a few new investigators, but then none of them showed up for their return appointments so that was rough. Ha we are still plugging along though. Hopefully we can find some solid people soon!<br/><br/>Snow Storm:<br/>I can't believe it's been like 60 degrees back at home... ha it's been so cold here this week! On Monday it was particularly bad. We were on the bus and got caught in this crazy snow storm. The bus route was supposed to go up this big hill, but we were stuck at the bottom of it for almost an hour! We taught this cool kid named Darnell while we waited though so it wasn't a complete waste of time. I am just grateful we didn't have to drive in it ourselves! I would've been freaking out! Thank goodness for the bus(:<br/><br/>Ping Pong:<br/>A few times a week after our morning run we played ping pong ha it was way fun! What I wouldn't give to throw down on ya up at the cabin(; Also with all this snow I must admit I have missed snowmobiling a TON! Good thing I get home during the winter so we can go straight up to the cabin and hit up the loop!<br/><br/>The Book of Mormon Answers Questions:<br/>This week we had a couple really cool lessons where we taught about how the Book of Mormon answers questions. We asked our investigators to write down a question they had and we both did the same then we read a random Book of Mormon chapter together, discussing it as we read, looking for the answer! We read a different chapter each time we taught the lesson and each time we all found answers to the questions we had in mind. Such a powerful experience! After that experience I decided to try to ask more questions during personal study. So before studies I write down a question then start reading from the scriptures looking for my answer. As I study I take note of any thoughts or impressions in a study journal. Asking questions and then underlining, highlighting, and writing down the answers I receive has helped me be more in tune with the spirit and receive direct personal revelation.<br/><br/>Transfers:<br/>It's transfer time again and unfortunately it's Sister King's time to move on. I sure am going to miss her. I have learned SO much from Sister King and we've become such good friends over the last few months! She has definitely internalized her purpose as a missionary and is such a powerful representative of Jesus Christ. She's been serving here in Madison for 6 months and now she is headed to Wausau to be a Sister Training Leader! I am staying here in Madison and will serve with Sister Schlosser. I don't know anything about her other than she has been out for 2 transfers so she just finished her training. I'm excited to meet her! I am nervous to take over the area - especially navigating the busses! It will be a really good opportunity for me to rely on the spirit though and grow a ton! As Sister King and I were walking along Segoe road when the sun was setting I just felt at peace about transfers and about the work we had done together. Can't wait to continue helping the work move forward here in Madison!<br/><br/>Hope you have a great week - love and miss you!<br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>Hope you all had a good week. Things here have been as busy as always!<br/><br/>Finding:<br/>So the thing about baptizing all of your progressing investigators is then you don't have any progressing investigators... ugh. Ha what a wonderful problem to have though(: We have a small teaching pool, but the investigators we are working with right now are progressing very slowly so we've been doing a whole lot of finding this week! We bus contacted quite a bit and had success in giving out copies of the Book of Mormon. We met this super cute girl named Tasia and set up an appointment to meet with her later this week!<br/><br/>Learning to Knit:<br/>The ward has a knitting group that meets together once a month and this week we went with a couple of our investigators! Thankfully Deserae, a less active we have been working with, has been teaching us to knit so we had a project to work on while we were there. Ha it was a lot of fun to chat with the ladies in the ward and knit scarves! Our investigators really liked it as well and got to meet some of the Relief Society ladies.<br/><br/>Stampin Up Card Class:<br/>This week we were super crafty! Not only did we knit, but we also attended Sister Durschi's Stampin' Up card class with our investigator Jeanie. The last few weeks Jeanie has been super busy with school and cancelled our appointments, but we were able to reconnect at this card class and set up a time to meet this week! Huge tender mercy! We also used it as a finding activity and chatted with all the non-members there - it was awesome! Plus stamping cards is always fun(:<br/><br/>Interviews:<br/>This week we had interviews with President Cutler! Interviews are always such a cool learning experience. We prepared for interviews by studying Elder Christofferson's talk from General Conference, "Free Forever, to Act for Themselves". Ahh it is soo good. During interviews I asked President what I could do to have a better study journal and he showed me his which was super intense! This week I have been trying to be better at recording the thoughts and impressions I have as I study. It's only been a few days, but I already feel like my studies are more meaningful and that the spirit is teaching me what I need to know. I am so grateful for President and Sister Cutler and all they do!<br/><br/>Snow and the Sacrament:<br/>Church was cancelled throughout the Madsion Stake yesterday after we got like 6 inches of new powder. It continued to snow all day and by the time Sister King and I were walking back home for the night we were trudging through snow up to the top of our tall boots! It was crazy - so much snow in such a short amount of time! When we found out church was cancelled we were super bummed, we never plan a back up for church! Ha but then President Cutler gave the District Leaders permission to administer the sacrament to their district so we met as a district at church and had a mini Sacrament meeting. I was so grateful we still got to partake of the sacrament, it has become something I truly look forward to each week. I am grateful we had the chance to renew our covenants then have a testimony meeting together. Such a special experience. Then we went back out into the snow! Behind our apartment complex there is this big field I really wanted to snowmobile in! Ha I settled for making a snow angel though(:<br/><br/>Love and miss you, thanks for the prayers and support! Transfers are next week so we will see what happens - really hoping Sister King and I get another one together here in Madison!<br/><br/><div>

</div><h1>Conference is Coming!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-8847332401685941655" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear family and friends,<br/><br/>Has another week seriously gone by? I'm racking my brains trying to remember what actually happened this week... Ha the bus conversations this week switched from the weather to the Badgers killin it in March Madness! Everyone is super pumped UW made it to the final four! People here have soo much spirit, everyone is decked out in red and white. Go Badgers!<br/><br/>Preparing for the Temple:<br/>This week we did lots of finding, but also had some lessons with recent converts who are getting ready to go to the temple! Shaun and Janet were baptized just over a year ago and are now preparing to go to the temple to receive their Endowments in May. We had a lesson with each of them this week and they are both so ready! It has been fun to see how their testimonies have grown as they have been preparing to go through. Oh and yesterday Jada got her temple recommend so she can go on the youth temple trip next month - so excited for her!<br/><br/>General Women's Broadcast:<br/>On Saturday night the Relief Society got together for a nice dinner and then to watch the Women's General Broadcast. The broadcast focused on the family a ton which was cool because we have been trying really hard to find families to teach! Elder Eyring said when the Savior is the center of each of our individual lives our families will be strengthened. I think the inverse of that is also true that as the Savior becomes the center of our families each individual family member will be strengthened. It makes me think of the part of the Family Proclamation where it says, "Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ." I definitely saw that to be true growing up and am grateful for this chance to help the families here in Madison come to experience this as well!<br/><br/>Youth 5th Sunday Lesson:<br/>Sister Schlosser and I got to teach the youth 5th Sunday lesson with Elder Harding and Elder Mac! We talked about missionary work and had fun interacting with the youth. We split them up in groups and tackled different questions turning to Preach My Gospel and the scriptures. It ended up being really fun and I think the youth learned a lot about what they can be doing now to prepare and how they can invite their friends.<br/><br/>Because He Lives:<br/>If you haven't seen the 'Because He Lives' video, stop right now and go to <a href="http://lds.org/">lds.org</a> and watch it! Ha we have been telling everyone about it and giving out cards like candy! Yay for Easter and for the glorious resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I know He lives. I know He loves us. I know it's only through Him that we can return to our Heavenly Father and live happily with our families forever!<br/><br/>That's all I've got for ya.Hope you all have a fantastic Easter weekend and enjoy General Conference! As we come to conference prepared to be taught and willing to act on the revelation we receive I know Heavenly Father will bless us with answers to our deepest thoughts and questions! How grateful I am for the living prophet and apostles who testify of Christ, for a loving Heavenly Father who sent His son, and for a perfect Savior who paved the way for each of us!<br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>Madison Round 4</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-5492924089690626471" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear family and friends,<br/><br/>Well good news everyone, I'm staying in Madison!!! Sister Schlosser and I get another transfer together here and I couldn't be more excited and grateful! We've worked hard this transfer and are excited to reap the rewards and teach lots this coming transfer!<br/><br/>Prayer Prompting:<br/>This week we had a cool experience with a less active named Jessie. We found his name on a list in our apartment and decided to give him a call. We had a few different numbers for him so we tried them all and finally got him. We talked for a bit and felt prompted to pray with him. We didn't think much of it until he called us a few nights later expressing that he had been struggling and that since we had prayed with him over the phone he had felt God's love for him and been more determined to resist temptation. We have an appointment set up with him tonight in a member's home which we are super excited about! Hopefully we can help him come back to church!<br/><br/>Future Missionary:<br/>We have been meeting with Debra and Jada a couple times a week to teach their new member lessons and this week we asked Jada to teach us the lesson. She did a fantastic job explaining the principles of the lesson and afterward she told us she wants to be a missionary one day! Aww we about died! Jada is just the absolute cutest 12 year old girl ever and will make such an incredible missionary(:<br/><br/>All Mission Meeting in Milwaukee:<br/>We drove down to Pewaukee with the Madison 4th Ward sisters on Friday night and stayed with the Sefcik family. They were so kind to host us! Sister Sefcik went above and beyond and totally spoiled us. We felt like we were staying in a hotel with all the yummy food and clean linens she had on hand! I got to sleep in a full size bed which was heavenly! Then in the morning we got up and drove the rest of the way to Milwaukee for the meeting. At the last second Elder Perry got assigned to stay in Salt Lake and help get things ready for General Conference so it was Elder Christensen who came to visit us. It was such an incredible meeting - the spirit was so strong! We all learned and grew a ton I think. He taught about the Atonement and how it was possible because of love. At the end we had a small question and answer session and Elder Stewart asked how we could develop a more personal, intimate relationship with the Savior. Elder Christensen responded by turning to D&amp;C 67:10  ahhh soo good. Anyway the whole meeting ruled and afterward we took a picture all together as a mission. It was such a sweet experience to come together and see all my mission friends in one place! I loved catching up with Sister King and getting to see my MTC companion, Sister Escobar who I haven't seen for 9 months! Oh and Sister Christiansen and I sang in the choir together - so fun!<br/><br/>Madison Stake Conference:<br/>We had Stake Conference again in Madison which was weird since we barely had Stake Conference 3 weeks ago, but with the area seventy in town they decided to have another one! Our investigator Choley was kind enough to drive us and our investigator Jianguo made it too! It was his first time at church so we introduced him to some of the YSA Mandarin speaking members and his face just lit up! They talked a ton. We were so grateful Annie and Dan learned to speak Mandarin while on missions and were so willing to fellowship Jianguo and invite him to the FHE and institute activities this week - ahh so awesome! The meeting was super good too - they talked about accepting and magnifying your callings.<br/><br/>Other than that we are just staying busy teaching people and trying to help them progress. We talk with all kinds of different people everyday which is something I love about Madison - so much diversity! Everyone is at a different spot on the journey back to Heavenly Father, but He loves each one of His children and patiently works with each of us! I am so grateful for the privilege I have to represent His son and help His children in Madison, I love being a missionary! Hope you all have a good week and look for opportunities to testify of Christ - love you!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<br/><br/>P.S. Thanks for the granola, it definitely made my day(: Also the weather was nice all week and then we woke up to 5 inches of snow this morning - crazy!<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

Dear family and friends,<br/><br/>There were a couple days this week I actually went outside without a coat on! I haven't walked around outside with just a cardigan on in MONTHS! In fact, I don't think I ever have in Madison! Ha so yay for the warm weather we had this week(: It got up into the 60's which was fantastic. I guess it will be back in the low 40's this week though, but at least it isn't snowing! Sorry I always talk about the weather... haha probably 90% of the conversations I start with people on the bus have to do with the weather and then I try to casually transition into the gospel so maybe that's what I do with my letters too...(:<br/><br/>Zone Training Meeting<br/>This week we had Zone Training Meeting. It's always so fun to get together with the zone! We talked about the Priesthood and they emphasized doing things to find families! I love that President and Sister Cutler are all about families - Wisconsin needs more eternal families and we are sure trying hard to help with that! After the meeting we went to lunch at Chipotle to celebrate Elder Borgelthous' birthday and then to the Mad 2 building for a choir practice. There are 10 or so of us who are going to be singing on Saturday when Elder Perry comes. I am SOOO excited!(:<br/><br/>Getting Pumped for the 'All Mission Meeting'<br/>I just realized I haven't really talked much about this upcoming 'All Mission Meeting'. So basically what's going on is that we are gathering the entire mission together in Milwaukee on Saturday and Elder Perry is going to address us! I seriously cannot wait! For part of the program a few of us from the Madison West Zone are singing this super powerful arrangement of 'I Know That My Redeemer Lives' so that's the choir number I've been talking about. Anyway it is all super exciting(: We've been preparing as a mission by living what we call the F.A.S.T.<br/>       F.east on the Book of Mormon daily<br/>       A.ct in obedience<br/>       S.anctify yourselves through the sacrament<br/>       T.estify with your feet by teaching at least two sit down lessons a day<br/>It has been such a neat experience to unite as a mission and prepare for the coming of an apostle of the Lord! I have learned a lot as I have been making the F.A.S.T. a priority for the last month and now we just have one last push this week! Can't wait till Saturday!(:<br/><br/>Relief SocieTy Tea ParTy<br/>The Relief Society activity this month was a tea party and Sister Feriante went above and beyond with the decorations! I just want her to do my wedding one day - she's the absolute cutest! Ha we helped her set things up on our P-day last week and then the RS dinner was Tuesday night. It turned out perfectly and was well attended, we even had some investigators there!<br/><br/>Exchanges<br/>This week we also had exchanges with the Sister Training Leaders! I love being able to see my trainer for exchanges(: This time around I stayed in Madison and Sister Ostler came with me. I had fun showing her how to bus contact since she has been in car areas her whole mission. We had so much fun and saw soo many miralces - met this super solid guy named Jijean we hope to start teaching. Sister Ostler finishes her mission this week - I sure will miss her! I have loved serving around her and have learned a lot from her example of genuine kindness.<br/><br/>Patience and Faith<br/>So I've mentioned all the fun exciting things from this week, but in all honesty this week was hard. Soo hard. We set a baptismal date with our investigator Tiffany on Monday and on Saturday she dropped us! Moments like this are so heart breaking. We had a few other really promising investigators drop us and cancel appointments this week too so it's been super hard. I've been feeling pretty down about it and wondering why this is happening after all our hard work. Then this morning I read in chapter 6 of Preach My Gospel about the Christ-like attribute of patience. Sister Schlosser and I have been working really hard all transfer to see miracles happen and help people progress, but it seemed like things came crashing down this week. In Preach My Gospel it talked about how patience is related to faith and hope. Reading that seemed like such a wake-up call to me! I know Heavenly Father is preparing families here in Madison to accept the gospel - I just need to be patient, have faith, and keep working. I'm excited for one last push with the F.A.S.T. this week and for the all mission meeting on Saturday. I know this is the Lord's work and He truly is directing it. I am so grateful for the chance to be an instrument in His hands!<br/><br/>Jianguos a Man?<br/>One last story... since it has been warmer outside there have been LOADS of people out and about and they all seem to be in better moods so we've had lots of success talking with people! We handed out tons of #BecauseHeLives cards with our number and address for the church on the back and randomly Jianguo texted us after we had met on the bus. Turns out we also met a woman with a similar name on the bus that day so we got them mixed up and thought she had texted us... We ended up inviting him to the Relief Society Activity and setting a return appointment. Ha thank goodness he didn't show up to the RS tea party, but on Thursday we went over for a lesson with him and realized he's a guy! Ha so then we had to get a member to come and it was crazy, but all worked out! We've met with him twice now and he has a baptismal date for April 18th! If you could keep him in your prayers that would be great!!! <br/><br/>Well there ya have it. I hope you all had a fun week and for all you math nerds out there - that you enjoyed pi day(: We ate at the Cocke's that night - they are both mathematicians so they were all excited that it was 3.1415 this year ha so yay for that. This week we also had homemade pot stickers with the Thurstons! They were good, but it made me miss your pot stickers Mom! Haha love and miss you guys! And happy birthday this week Trev!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<br/><br/>P.S. Hope you enjoyed the subject line boys - with the Jianguo situation I couldn't resist! Haha(:<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>Blue Skies and Sunshine - FINALLY!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-73806448109306092" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>Good news, the sun is shining and it's a balmy 40 degrees here in Madison! The past few days have been absolutely WONDERFUL! I may have prematurely packed away my giant coat, but for now my thinner one is great so maybe the packing was an act of faith? Ha we are really hoping the weather stays nice! Warmer weather = more people outside = more people to talk to and teach = happy missionaries(:  It seems like everyone is in a better mood now that spring is in the air. The snow is melting like crazy and there are huge mud puddles everywhere! Yay for March! <br/><br/>Choosing to Act:<br/>Before the weather warmed up and things started looking up there were a few hard days this week when I just felt really down and inadequate. Our appointments were all falling through and no one wanted to talk with us. I was in a bit of a rut until I read Elder Christofferson's talk from this past General Conference, "Free Forever, to Act for Themselves." Now I know I've raved about this talk in the past, but seriously, it's SO good! Ha I realized I needed to get over myself or as Elder Christofferson challenged, 'take responsibility and go to work so that thereis something for God to help us with.' I changed my attitude and went to work and BAM miracles happened! Sister Schlosser and I taught a killer Word of Wisdom lesson, tracted into and set a return appointment with this awesome mother and daughter, and met this solid woman named Jianguo at the bus top who is now coming to the Relief Society activity tomorrow night! That experience just helped me realize how important it is to act in faith because, 'God will not act to make us something we do not choose by our actions to become.' Trust God - He will help us, but we have to help ourselves too!<br/><br/>Dirty Dishes:<br/>This week we probably spent a solid three hours doing dishes. That being said, I would like to make it clear that we aren't slobs - ha they weren't our dishes! We were helping out a less active and serving the members. But yeah, three hours. My fingers were sooo pruney afterwards. It was awesome.<br/><br/>Daylight Savings Time:<br/>Dang daylight savings totally messed with us this week. We were almost late to ward council and a couple of our investigators didn't set their alarms early enough to get to church. We were super bummed because we had worked really hard to get them rides to church and set up fellowshippers and all that. Ughh. Ha at least it will be brighter later now - that definitely makes evening missionary work a lot easier! Hope you were all able to set your clocks correctly and didn't struggle like us!<br/><br/>So I have to apologize because I didn't take ANY pictures this week! Super lame, I know. I will try to take more pictures this week of us out enjoying the sunshine(: Well I think that's pretty much it - we're doing well and the work is coming along. We had fun this week contacting around the Capitol - it was a lot easier to get people to stop and chat with us in the warmer weather. We should be setting a solid baptismal date with Tiffany and her fiancé tonight so we're super excited. Hope you all have a great week - thanks for all the love, support, and encouragement! I love and miss ya, but wouldn't want to be anywhere else!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:

</div><h1>March Already?</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7810674176277797281" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear family and friends,<br/><br/>Sister Schlosser and I feel so blessed to have been so busy this week! We've just been praying to be instruments in God's hand and to have lots of work to do. It's taken time, but things are starting to pick up again! We are excited for those we are working with to progress in this amazing gospel!(:<br/><br/>Temple and Family History Work:<br/>It's been forever since I have been to the temple... oh how I wish there was one here in Wisconsin! The temple in Chicago is the closest to us here in Madison, but that is a good 3 hour drive or so. I hope you all appreciate how blessed you are to live so close to so many temples! Go regularly! This week we taught one of Kendall's new member lessons about the Plan of Salvation, but we tied in temples and family history too. We helped her get an account set up on Family Search and begin entering in the names of her family members. What a neat opportunity and sacred responsibility we have to do the work for our own ancestors! I love the temple and am so grateful for the things we can learn there about the Plan of Salvation!<br/><br/>Activity Days:<br/>The Activity Day Girls fed us dinner this week! It was so fun to join them for an activity. They are the cutest! I remember being in Activity Days and loving my amazing leaders and friends. Aww such good times(: The girls had to plan and prepare a nutritious dinner for one of their Faith in God requirements so we had fun talking about eating healthy and staying active. We talked with them about how they could share the gospel with their friends and neighbors. Sister Schlosser and I reminded the girls that they need to prepare themselves and work on developing their own testimonies so they can be ready to share and help others learn more about the Savior. Really fun activity - now I just want to be an activity days leader(:<br/><br/>Tiffany:<br/>Wow where to even begin. Teaching Tiffany has been the biggest miracle! We just feel so grateful to have been able to meet her and begin working with her. She is our most promising investigator right now and she has such a genuine desire to know the truth. She has two little kids, a 6 year-old little girl and a 6 month old little boy. She has a strong testimony of God, but doesn't have much religious background at all. As we shared the Plan of Salvation with her the spirit was so strong! She committed to be baptized and we are working with her to set solid wedding and baptism dates. Her fiancé is willing to listen to us as well so we will get to meet him later this week! We are SO excited to teach a family!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(:<br/><br/>Stake Conference:<br/>We had Stake Conference this weekend - always such an uplifting experience. I am learning how to receive revelation during meetings - I think it is all about asking questions beforehand and recording the promptings and thoughts that come while you listen. Anyway great meeting and we got to see lots of the other missionaries and President and Sister Cutler!<br/><br/>Choir Practice:<br/>In March the entire mission is gathering together to be taught by an Apostle. We don't know who is coming yet, but we are all preparing and looking forward to March 21st! I am part of a small missionary choir that will sing "I Know that My Redeemer Lives" that day. We practiced after Stake Conference for a while - the arrangement is beautiful!<br/><br/>St. David's Day:<br/>We celebrated St. David's Day with the Feriante family last night! Sister Feriante is from Wales and she made a traditional Welsh dinner of lamb with mint jelly, steamed vegetables, parsnips, mashed potatoes and gravy, the works! Mmm it was soo tasty! Plus she made Welsh cakes for dessert - mmm(: The members here take such good care of us! I hope you invite the missionaries over and watch out for them too! Go to lessons with them, feed them dinner, invite your friends to be taught by them! Haha there is my missionary plug for the week(:<br/><br/>Well I think that is about all! We were just busy talking with people and teaching lessons all week - ha same as usual(: Sounds like you are all doing well - keep reading your scriptures and saying your prayers and all that. It truly makes all the difference! As we make the effort to communicate with our Father in Heaven, He in turn will speak to us and our relationship will be made stronger. Love and miss you!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

The bus finally came and we </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">got on and just stood in the isle because we were so wet, but this </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">nice man offered us a seat so we went over and chatted with him.

</div><h1>Homemade Jam(:</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-8321757193147263339" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear family and friends,<br/><br/>Hola everyone. Hope all is well back home(:<br/><br/>Cleaning Inspection:<br/>I felt like I was back in Heritage Halls this week as we had to frantically deep clean our apartment for the routine cleaning check! Our apartment was pretty nasty so it was good to spend the time scrubbing and de-cluttering. The place looks loads better now and we are going to get a microwave that actually works so we're super excited!<br/><br/>Car Mat Picnic:<br/>We got to meet with Kendall a couple times this week which was great! She is such an incredible woman. I seriously look up to her so much! She has such a great energy and spirit about her and constantly lifts other up. I am so grateful to have been able to help teach her and know her! We did some family history work together at the church family history center and then had a picnic in the park. We were all in skirts so we grabbed her car mats and sat on those - genius! It was great to have a lesson and enjoy the sunshine together(:<br/><br/>Cramer Couple:<br/>That awkward moment when you almost street contact a totally active couple... Ha that happened yesterday when we were out tracting. We saw this cute older couple walking by on the other side of the road so we said hello and walked over to try to street contact them, but as we walked over we realized it was the Cramers in the ward! Ha so instead we chatted and they ended up having us over for dinner an hour later after we'd finished tracting out their neighborhood! It was so fun to get to know them at dinner and hear the story of their conversion. Brother Cramer just doted on his wife and kept filling up our soup bowls - ha we were absolutely stuffed afterwards!<br/><br/>Memorial Union:<br/>This week we had a lesson with our investigator Sarah at Memorial Union, a beautiful UW outdoor study area right on Lake Mendota! It was such a pretty day and we had a really good lesson together. We explained more about the Priesthood and she said she 'got the feels' while we were talking about how she needs to be baptized by the proper authority - ahh so solid!<br/><br/>Peyote on the Bus:<br/>Met this Native American man named Jimmy on the bus and he pulled out some peyote for me. So that was good. We had a nice conversation. We're friends now I think.<br/><br/>Surprise Package:<br/>Pretty sure I have the world's best trainer - this week I came home to find a package from her Grandma! Ha I guess Sister C had asked Grandma Worthington to send me some of her homemade jam because she used to get it when we were companions and I loved it! So sweet Grandma Worthington, a woman I don't even know sent me delicious homemade jam in a nice little package! Aww seriously so kind and such a fun surprise! Sister Christiansen is the best(: This morning we went shopping with the STL's (Sisters Christiansen and Vang) and the Sun Prairie Sisters (Sister Cosgrove and Jensen). It was super fun to hangout with the sisters, but so sad to say goodbye to Sister C! She is going home this Thursday to spend time with her Mom. Please keep their family in your prayers!<br/><br/>Public Speaking Practice:<br/>This week I was asked to give a training in District Meeting and give a talk in church! It seemed like they both went well. In DTM I presented a training on Diligence which is the Christ like attribute I am studying this transfer. I love the definition given in Preach My Gospel, 'diligence is steady, consistent, earnest, and energetic effort in doing the Lord’s work.' D&amp;C 58:27 also sums it up nicely<br/>teaching that we should be 'anxiously engaged' as we go to work we give the Lord something to help us with! Then later I was assigned to speak with the High Councilor on how to fellowship. I used the light house/lower lights analogy about how the Savior is the lighthouse leading us back to our heavenly harbor with the Father and we are the lower lights that should help our lost brothers and sisters find the light of the Savior. I talked about how we must 1) turn on our light - by strengthening our own testimonies and becoming truly converted and 2) hold up our light - by reaching out to love and serve our brothers and sisters. Then closed with the words of 'Brightly Beams Our Father's Mercy.' Afterwards I got quite a few compliments on it and Brother Sorensen, the high council man who also spoke, referenced back to things I'd shared. The talks seemed to go well together and brought a special spirit.<br/><br/>We're struggling to find new people to teach, but we are working hard and learning loads. We have just two weeks left of the transfer so we are trying to go hard and finish strong! Thanks for the prayers and encouragement - it means the world(: Love and miss you!<br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

Dear family and friends,<br/>
<br/>
This week was a whirlwind! Hope you have all been doing well(: Glad to hear you guys made it back safe and sound from Orlando - the pictures are amazing!!!<br/>
<br/>
Zone Training Meeting:<br/>
The Madison West Zone rules - seriously love the Elders and Sisters here so much! The Sister Training Leaders talked about our mission culture and how we want to be more dignified. Then the Zone Leaders did a training on sacrifice and consecration. They talked about how we need to ask ourselves what our motivation behind our obedience is - is it 1) fear, 2) blessings, or 3) love. Obviously it is good to obey regardless of our motives, but we will be more powerful if we are truly motivated by our love for our Father in Heaven, our Savior, and those we serve. Elder Anderson shared Mosiah 2:34 about how we must render to God all that we HAVE and ARE.' All that we HAVE meaning to make sacrifices and all that we ARE meaning to become consecrated. They invited us to fast for 24 hours and let the spirit guide us as to what we can do to become more consecrated and then to make that change with a 40 day fast. We started with the 24 hour fast yesterday and already I have felt the spirit so strongly helping me to keep moving forward and BECOME better/more consecrated through the power of the Atonement.<br/>
<br/>
Surprise Exchanges:<br/>
This week we went on a surprise exchange! The Sister Training Leaders called us and wanted to switch up our exchange times which was great because we had actually got the dates switched on our calendars and had thought they were going to be this week anyway. Turns out we all really needed to go on the exchange and that was definitely a blessing in disguise that we had planned things out accordingly. I got to go to Madison 2nd Ward with my lovely trainer, Sister C and Sister Vang came<br/>
here to be with Sister Schlosser. Spending time with Sister Christiansen was just what we both needed! She's been going through a ton lately with family stuff so I was grateful to be there to talk things through with her. She is an amazing missionary and such a great example to me! It's been fun to be able to go on exchanges and see how we have both grown and become better missionaries since we served together. Plus we always have a blast reminiscing old times in Rapids(: I sure will miss Sister C when she leaves in May!<br/>
<br/>
Bussing Probs:<br/>
Oh man the buses totally messed us up so many times this week. Ha we had some epic adventures though and even got a new investigator out of it, huge tender mercy! So we took the #14 for a change and it took us borderline out of our area so we were all stressed and had to find our way back and it started to rain super hard. Ha so there we were walking in the pouring rain, completely drenched and a bus miraculously appears and takes us back to Sheboygan! Then we were stranded in this sketchy area late at night because the buses didn't run so we asked directions from this little family and they kindly gave us a ride to the transfer point! The husband driving was blasting Kanye West's new album - ha which was super obscene, but we totally turned it into a teaching environment and prayed/gave a Book of Mormon to them!<br/>
<br/>
Lucy's Baptism:<br/>
Gigi's daughter Lucy was baptized this week so we got to help the Spanish Elders set up for that. The service was all done in Spanish and I am happy to report I am starting to understand more and more of it! Hermano Chaupparo is always trying to teach us Spanish and we try to teach him English - it's a hoot! The spanish members are the best(: I got to help with the music, the spirit was so strong I loved it!<br/>
<br/>
Checkin out the Singles Ward:<br/>
We got permission to go to the campus ward Relief Society this week with our investigator Sarah - it was super fun! It seemed like Sarah enjoyed it so we are hoping she will be comfortable staying on her own now that she knows what it is like. The YSAs did a great job of fellowshipping her which we were grateful for! I hope you all are great fellowshippers too - if you don't know someone you see at<br/>
church, introduce yourself and help them to feel comfortable and loved!<br/>
<br/>
Ring Check:<br/>
Seems like we're constantly doing the 'ring check' when we meet people because we want to teach families! Single adults are great and all, but we'll save them for the campus elders(: Ha we work pretty closely with them handing off investigators and giving each other referrals, but this week a hand off went totally awry! So we have been teaching Jianguo for the past month or so, but we got a strong impression that Elder Feist and Elder Christian needed to work with him. At first we didn't want to give him up, but we decided it would be best since he was unmarried and still YSA age. We had a great hand off lesson, but as we walk out the Elders told us that Jianguo had told them separately that he is actually married and his wife lives in Beijing! Say what?! Ha we had NO IDEA!!! So now we are in this predicament of having handed him over to the YSA, but he should actually be in the family ward.. so we gotta sort that one out. Apparently not everyone wears a wedding ring.. or mentions their spouse..<br/>
<br/>
Well that's about it! Thanks for the prayers and support - I've definitely been feeling them! Please keep Sister Christiansen and her Mom (she's battling cancer) in your prayers this week too! The Savior truly brings us strength and comfort during the hard times. Love and miss you all!<br/>
<br/>

Dear family and friends,<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the Orlando trip has been a success(: I loved seeing all the pictures! Enjoy the sunshine and roller coasters these next few days and travel back safe!<br/>
<br/>
Ultimate Frisbee:<br/>
Gotta through this in here for Zach - we got together with the zone last P-day and played Ultimate! It was so much fun! Hopefully we'll do it again today in a few hours(:<br/>
<br/>
Cupcakes with Rachel:<br/>
On Tuesday we celebrated our recent convert Rachel's birthday with her and her sweet family! It was fun to enjoy a vegetarian meal together. Rachel was telling us about why/how she became vegetarian and how her husband Bob converted over to being vegetarian as well. I teased him about being super good at converting...(: Ha we hope one day Bob will join the church, he's such a great guy! I love that Bob supports Rachel with everything she does - I am grateful for their example of a relationship that works!<br/>
<br/>
Looks Painful:<br/>
We were knocking doors this week when we saw this super bright teal house on a corner. There are so many sweet looking houses here in Madison! Ha but anyway we knocked this teal door and met this guy who was in the middle of giving himself a tattoo! It looked so painful! He was super excited to show us this corpse mermaid thing though so we listened then talked to Him about Jesus! Ha good times(:<br/>
<br/>
Directed to Trevor:<br/>
This week it seemed like we missed our buses a lot so we'd be stranded somewhere randomly for a little while waiting for the next bus or walking for a really long time to our next appointment. We made the best of those situations though by trying to listen to the promptings of the spirit and talk with the people placed in our path. We met a few solid people this way, but the highlight of the week was when we met this college student named Trevor. His apartment building had stuck out to me, but when no one answered the first bell we turned to leave to catch our bus. Then Sister Schlosser felt prompted to ring the other bell so we did and out came Trevor! We got talking with him and found out he was having a hard time after a bad breakup - we prayed with him and the spirit was super strong! I'm grateful we listened to the spirit and were being diligent despite the buses not working out.<br/>
<br/>
Jada's 1st Temple Trip:<br/>
This week we were able to help our recent convert Jada get to the temple with the Young Women! It was fun to bus her to the church and talk to her about what the temple would be like. We told her about the special spirit that is at the temple. I miss being able to go to the temple and hope you are all making temple attendance a priority! We are so blessed to live at a time when there are so many temples on the earth. The temple truly is the House of the Lord, a place where we can feel peace and renewal!<br/>
<br/>
General Conference:<br/>
How grateful I am for a living prophet who leads and guides the church! President Monson is such a great Christ-like example of love and service. We are so blessed to get to hear from the prophet and<br/>
apostles twice a year - conference is the best! I am grateful for the answers I received and for the strength I felt come from listening to conference. I liked what Elder Eyring taught about fasting and am excited to make fasting a more spiritual experience. I was also grateful for Elder Bednar's thoughts about overcoming fear - fear truly is the opposite of faith! Then Elder Holland and Elder Uchtdorf back to back talks about different parts of the Atonement was SOO powerful! I am excited to study them more in depth and apply the things I learned! We had fun watching conference at the church with investigators, recent converts, a few ward members, and the other missionaries. In between the sessions we had a big lunch and enjoyed talking about what we had learned(:<br/>
<br/>
Easter Sunday:<br/>
In preparation for Easter  I took the time to study the last week of the Savior's life. I am so grateful for Him and His perfect example. He was motivated by love and performed the Atonement to fulfill the Father's will. I know He lives! He is there to lift and comfort us! Rely on Him. Turn to Him. Find Him. I love my Savior and am so grateful for how my relationship with Him has been strengthened while serving as a missionary!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had a wonderful General Conference/Easter weekend - if you didn't get the chance to watch conference check out <a href="http://lds.org/">lds.org</a> to catch the messages again then go and apply them! Thanks for all the support and encouragement! Love you guys(:<br/>

<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Dear fam and friends,</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">This week was crazy busy, I can't believe it's already May 18th! Where </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">did April even go? Going on one or more exchanges each week is going </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">to be exhausting, but the sisters here are amazing! I am so excited to </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">keep getting to know them!</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Exchanges in Appleton:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">This week I went on my first exchange as a Sister Training Leader! </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Before the exchange I read from my old journal about my very first </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">exchange with Sister Jardine. She encouraged me and helped me a ton. I </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">remember thinking she taught with so much power and knew the </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">scriptures super well. I hope I can learn from and be an example for </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">the Sisters like Sister Jardine and my other STL's have been for me! </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">It is so weird to be on the older end of things in the mission! </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Exchanges in Appleton with Sister Adams-Hart were a blast this week - </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">she just got finished being trained and already confidently leads out! </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">I was impressed by how diligent and hard working she is. We got a few </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">return appointments and new investigators as we were out contacting </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">together. Sister Rousseau and Sister Pope saw miracles in our area as </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">well - they met a family, taught the Restoration, invited them to be </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">baptized... AND THEY SAID YES!!!! Yay for exchange miracles(:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">The Mills Family:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Real quick I have to rave about this cute family in our ward here - </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">the Mills! They are amazing! Sister Mills is the Relief Society </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">President and Brother Mills is the Ward Mission Leader. They do a lot </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">to help the missionaries out so this week we sought out an opportunity </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">to serve them! Service rules(: We had fun helping/getting to know </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">their family. They have 4 little girls and 1 baby boy. Their daughters </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">are so stinkin smart, their 12 year old has already read the entire </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">standard works! That totally puts me to shame! She definitely inspired </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">me so this week I started Genesis. I've listened to the assigned Old</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Testament chapters for seminary, but never actually read the whole </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">thing so this should be fun! Sister Adams-Hart gave me a reading chart </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">to read the standard works in a year so here goes!</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Samuel the Lamanite Cake:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">We have a weekly Book of Mormon Book Club meeting with our </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">investigator Jamie and this week we finished Helaman so we celebrated </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">by eating a Samuel the Lamanite Cake! It was super delish and fun to </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">join the Green Bay 1st Sisters. Sister Packer and I were in the same </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">YSA ward at BYU and now get to serve in Green Bay near each other! She </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">came out with Sister Pope, Sister King, and Sister Christiansen. Their </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">group goes home in 2 months! We celebrated Sister Pope and Sister </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Packer's 16 month mark this week and went out to Smart Cow (which is </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">like Wisconsin's Menchies). It was fun to celebrate together - I sure </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">do love those two(:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Member Referrals:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">We got a super solid member referral this week - member referrals are </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">a missionary's dream! Brother Sieber asked us to teach his best </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">friend's Mom. Her name is Lori. She has a Catholic background, but </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">hasn't been active in her Catholic faith for a long time. She is going </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">through a lot right now and reached out to Brother Sieber asking why </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">he is so happy all the time. He invited her to meet with us to learn </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">more about his faith. We met Lori on Friday morning with Brother </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Sieber and had such a powerful lesson together! Seriously the spirit </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">was SO strong as we testified of the Restoration and of a loving </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Heavenly Father. We are really excited to teach her!</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Learning to Cook:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">I didn't realize how lucky I was in Madison to eat with the members so </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">often! In Madison we really didn't have to worry about cooking too </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">much. Things seem to be different here in Green Bay though so I am </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">looking forward to enhancing my cooking skills! Sister Winchester in </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">the ward was so thoughtful and picked up a crock-pot for us this week </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">so we have plans to make something delicious(: Also we learned how to </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">make sour dough with the Relief Society and now have little sour dough </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">starts in the fridge. We're going to try to make sour dough pancakes </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">in a little while so we'll see how that turns out - hopefully they </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">turn out as good as dad's!(:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Preserving the Record:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">It's been super frustrating to come to this area because the records </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">haven't been kept very well. Our area book hasn't been fully updated </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">in over a year in some places and the ward directory is a mess. There </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">are recent converts who haven't been taught all of their new member </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">lessons and investigators who have been being taught for a while, but </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">have no teaching record! Updating the records is a pain, but SO </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">important! I really hope we get iPads one day so this can all be done </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">electronically. Updating things has been hard because Sister Pope has </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">only been here for 6 weeks so she is still getting to know the area </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">too. An English set of Elders were doubled into the ward this transfer </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">as well so we've been working closely with them to figure everything </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">out. We're starting to get things organized and seem to have a better </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">handle on who we need to teach.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Well that's about all I've got for ya this week! The subject line is </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">courtesy of the local Lutheran congregation, they've always got great </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">sayings up.

<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Dear family and friends,</span><br/>
<br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">AHH it was so so good to talk with you yesterday!(: I cannot believe </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">how grown up the boys are getting, it's crazy! Since we just talked </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">there isn't a ton to fill you in on, but I'll try to hit some </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">highlights from this last week. Transfers always make everything super </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">crazy, but they are great(: I am so excited to be here in Green Bay </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">with Sister Pope!</span><br/>
<br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Goodbye Madtown:</span><br/>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Spent some time on Monday and Tuesday saying good bye to people in </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Madison! The Allreds had us over for a Cambodian dinner at their new </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">house, we went out for ice cream with Coley, we visited Janet, had one </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">last lesson with Ishmael at the church, ate at Olive Garden with </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Hayley, celebrated Shaun's birthday with him, stopped by Edgewood </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">college to say goodbye to Shay, bused around Capitol Square one final </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">time stopping to see Rachel and Kendall, and then met with Julia </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">before heading back to finish packing! I started packing a lot earlier </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">this time around so the packing experience was a lot less stressful. I </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">don't know how I was able to fit all of my junk in those two suit </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">cases, but it all worked out and we were ready to go in the morning(: </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">I sure am grateful for the opportunity I had to serve in Madison and </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">meet so many incredible people! I love them a lot!!!</span><br/>
<br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Transfer Details:</span><br/>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">On Wednesday morning the Mad 2 STLs picked us up and drove us to the </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Mad 2 building where we had a little devotional and met with the other </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">missionaries being transferred. Sister Schlosser and I said goodbye </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">before I drove to Oshkosh with Brother and Sister Amberson. Oshkosh is t</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">he central transfer point for our mission so we had another little </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">devotional thing when we met there and then we all headed back to our </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">new areas! Once we made it to Green Bay I got to meet Sister Pope, my </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">new companion, and she is super great! I am so excited to work with </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">her! I also got to see Sister Packer who was in my YSA ward at BYU! </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">She's in the Green Bay 1st Ward so we will get to see each other a lot </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">and go on exchanges together(:</span><br/>
<br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Hello Green Bay:</span><br/>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Green Bay is a lot smaller than Madison, that's for sure. It is very </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">different here... ha so it'll take some getting used to! We drive by </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">the Lambeau field all the time though which is sweet - the NFL stadium </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">is HUGE! The missionary apartment here is smaller than the other two </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">I've stayed in, but a lot nicer. There are lots of windows so I am </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">loving all the natural light we get! This week Sister Pope and I have </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">been keeping busy with appointments, contacting, tracting, and </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">figuring out exchange details! I am so excited to get to know the </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">other sisters and go on exchanges with them! Our first exchange will </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">be this coming week with the Appleton Sisters. We go on a total of 6 </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">exchanges throughout the transfer, about one a week. This week we </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">tracted into a nun! Her name is Sister Miller. We talked for almost 30 </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">minutes and shared the 'Because He Lives' video with her. She wasn't </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">super interested, but she was so kind!</span><br/>
<br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Well I think that's about it! It was so fun to talk with you guys </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">yesterday(: Thanks for the support and encouragement, you guys are the </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">best! Hope you had a Happy Mother's Day Mom, I sure do love and look </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">up to you!(:</span><br/>
<br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"/>

</div><h1>From Badger Land to Packer Land</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7559952992442790621" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear family and friends,<br/><br/>I have like zero time to write this so I'll try to just hit the highlights! First of all.... We got the transfer text on Saturday and I'll be leaving Madison): I am super bummed because I absolutely love it here, but I also feel at peace and completely trust that Heavenly Father knows where I need to be! We found out today that I will be going up to Green Bay to serve as a Sister Training Leader (STL) with Sister Pope! I am absolutely terrified to be an STL, but so excited to serve in Green Bay. I have heard great things about Packer land(:<br/><br/>Nepali Family:<br/>This week we did lots of contacting and tracting in the nice weather. We reconnected with a woman named Sarasoti who had met the Sisters on the bus last summer. We set up an appointment with her and visited her and her grown family. They are from Nepal and shared some of their culture and beliefs with us. They are Hindu, but Sarasoti was interested in learning more about the Book of Mormon. She is very kind and so is her family! They were such kind hosts insisting we had some Nepali drink and as we left they bowed and said 'Namaste' and gave us a few referrals of their neighbors! I love all the different cultures and backgrounds of the people here in Madison - I will miss that a lot!<br/><br/>Contacting at the Farmer's Market:<br/>There is a huge farmer's market up around Capitol Square every Saturday from May - October so it just started up and we decided to go do some contacting up there in the nice weather! We were able to talk with people and even got some compliments on our outfits! Haha we sure had a fun time(: We got some cheese bread and smoothies and took our lunch break on the capitol lawn - so fun!<br/><br/>Goodbye Again?<br/>A part of the mission I wasn't really anticipating was how difficult it would be to say goodbye to all of the investigators, recent converts, less actives, members, companions, and friends you make while out here. It is going to be sooo hard to leave Madison, but I am incredibly grateful for the chance I have had to serve here. It has been such a blessing! These people have truly changed me. During testimony meeting Emily got up and bore her testimony and the spirit was SO incredibly strong. I was just crying and crying thinking about where she was when I first got here and how far she has come. She has changed and now has a solid testimony rooted in the Savior. I am so grateful for her and for all those that I have had the opportunity to meet and learn from here. On Saturday we met with our new investigator Lun Cheng again and taught the Plan of Salvation. After the lesson I was explaining how I wouldn't be at the next lesson and I wished him well with his life and he said, 'it's okay I will see you in the Celestial' and pointed to the Celestial Kingdom we had drawn - ha it was such a tender moment! I look forward to that day, and of course for when I get home and bring you all out to visit and meet these amazing people!(:<br/><br/>Can't wait to talk to you all on Sunday from Green Bay!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>Strawberry Fields Forever</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-5730549047978034286" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>Time seems to be flying by out here - since when is it June??? Ha I am super excited for July though, we have a lot to look forward to with MLC, exchanges, and Jamie and Lori's baptisms!<br/><br/>Baptism Prep:<br/>This week we spent a lot of time with Jamie and Lori preparing them for their upcoming baptisms! We are so excited for both of them!!! It has been so fun to watch their testimonies grow. Jamie will be getting baptized in just under 2 weeks and we are working with Lori for the end of the month. Lori made it to church this week for the first time and absolutely loved it! It worked out perfectly because we had taken Sister Furhiman with us to Lori's lesson earlier in the week and then on Sunday they already knew each other and Sister Furhiman was able to sit with Lori and fellowship her! After church Lori told us how she had felt the spirit really strongly during the sacrament and that she<br/>loved how family oriented the church is/feels. She also commented on how sincere everyone is in their testimonies. Ahhh it was such a good Sunday(:<br/><br/>Oneida Reservation:<br/>We received a head quarter referral for a Barbara who lives on the Oneida Reservation so we plugged her address into the GPS and drove to THE most gorgeous area of Wisconsin, seriously we were dying it was so beautiful! When we got to our destination the address was off so we started talking with people outside and by some miracle were directed to Barbara! She happened to walk outside as we went up to her trailer and we were able to sit on her porch and teach her about the Book of Mormon! It was amazing how everything lined up for us to find her, such a miracle! Her niece is a member in the Spanish branch that meets in our building so we are looking forward to connecting with her this week too.<br/><br/>Sprint Celebs:<br/>This week the touch screen on our phone blew out so we couldn't send text messages or hang up if we answered a call! Ha so that made for an interesting few days.. we spent a couple afternoons in the local Sprint store getting it all sorted out, but by the end of the week we'd taught the gospel to 3 of the employees and everybody knew us when we walked in! Ha Sprint store celebrity status right there(:<br/>Elder Carter was great to help get us a new phone so now things are up and running. How grateful I am to have a phone to contact people!<br/><br/>Strawberry Pickin:<br/>Sister Pope and I couldn't help but think of the Beatles as we drove to this HUGE strawberry field this week. It seriously looked like it went on forever! As a service opportunity we helped pick strawberries and it was a blast!<br/><br/>Mini Miracles:<br/>This week we street contacted into a woman we tracted into the other day and she remembered us and loved us! Ha she really wants us to teach her son Brian, but I don't think he really wants us to teach<br/>him... ha so we are working on that. BUT it was a sweet miracle nonetheless. We also ran into Martez, another guy we street contacted into at the gas station. So yeah what are the chances of street<br/>contacting into people we've already talked with, that doesn't usually happen! We had a sweet miracle with this young Dad named Thaddeaus who was a member referral we taught him about the Book of Mormon and he wants to talk with his member friend (who also happens to be his next door neighbor) about it, we are excited about the potential there.<br/><br/>We are seeing miracles and trying to stay on top of everything! I can't believe I'll hit my year mark this week... With Sister Pope just a few weeks away from going home we've been reflecting on our mission experiences and the ways we've changed and grown closer to our Savior. I am so grateful for this past year and know it has and will continue to shape the course of my entire life. I am excited for the next 6 months of miracles!!! Hope you all have a good week, love you!!!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><h1>Happy Father's Day!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-3094574013135982174" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>Hope you all had a wonderful Father's Day yesterday! They had the young men speak in our ward about what they have learned from their father's about our Heavenly Father and how their relationships with their father compares to Heavenly Father's relationship with Jesus. It was a great meeting. I'm so grateful for my amazing Dad and the example he is to me! The good relationship we have helps me to better understand my relationship with my Father in Heaven and to feel of His<br/>love. Hope you were all able to thank your father's this week for all they do!<br/><br/>Green Bay Peeps:<br/>The last few weeks I've written a bunch about exchanges, but I don't think I have mentioned much about who we are consistently working with in our own area! Ha so since we didn't go on exchanges this week because of transfers I'll do my best to fill you in on a few of our solid investigators.<br/><br/>Jamie-<br/>First off is Jamie. She met the sisters/was given a copy of the Book of Mormon for the first time last July and has been investigating ever since. She has read the Book of Mormon cover to cover 4 times so far and absolutely loves it. I have never worked with an investigator with such a love and understanding of the BOM. Her BOM is covered in notes and she has such great insights. She will be getting baptized on July 11th - one year after receiving her first copy of the BOM, so<br/>exciting! We meet with her a few times a week for lessons and BOM book club. Last night we had a great discussion about what it means to have a 'broken heart and a contrite spirit.' Also Jamie is hilarious and always makes us laugh(:<br/>Lori-<br/>Brother Sieber referred us to Lori who is his childhood best friend's Mom, basically his second mother. She grew up devote Catholic, but disagreed with some of the things the local congregation was doing. She fell away and turned from God. During that time she was unhappy and often felt depressed. She noticed how Brother Sieber was always happy and she asked what made him so happy... Ha then he shared the gospel with her and invited her to meet with the sister missionaries and BOOM now she has a baptismal date(: Lori is absolutely amazing. Her lessons are always super powerful and she has a sincere desire to know the truth. This gospel is changing her life. She loves reading from the Book of Mormon and always tells her family about what she is learning. She's nervous to meet new people and hasn't been to church yet, but this week she came to the ward Pinewood Derby activity and really seemed to have a good time. This week we taught the Word of Wisdom. When she found out she couldn't drink tea or coffee anymore she said it would be a bit hard to give those things up, but that she would be willing to do it so she could be baptized. She has so much faith!<br/>Ashley-<br/>I think I wrote a bit about Ashley last week. We met her the other day when trying to contact a less active. Ashley was excited to read about the Book of Mormon and since then we've been able to meet with her a few times to teach about the Restoration and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. She really wants God in her life to guide her and her family. She accepted a baptismal invite, but her husband isn't super interested yet... we're going to get the Spanish Elders to help us out and hopefully he will be! She's seen miracles the last few days as she has been praying and truly feels that God has been with her. We are looking forward to continuing to help her and her family!<br/><br/>Community Service Opportunities:<br/>We had a few opportunities to do service in the community this week which is always good to get out and be seen by people in Green Bay. It is crazy how many people have never seen missionaries before - back home we'd see them out and about all the time it seemed like! Anyway we helped with a family fun run and the 'Day Out with Thomas' at the National Railroad Museum. We talked with a bunch of families and gave little kids Thomas the train tattoos.<br/><br/>Hmong Funeral:<br/>We've been working with this less active Hmong lady named Xee and this past week her mother passed away. She was really struggling, but we met with her a few times and were able to comfort her a bit. She asked us to come to her Mom's funeral to support her because her husband isn't super supportive so we agreed to go. The funeral was unlike anything I'd ever been to before! It was such a neat experience to learn more about Hmong culture. They rent out a funeral home place for a few days and have a big celebration with tons of food. They had animal sacrifices and there was all this raw meat in the kitchen area. They were cooking TONS of Hmong food which Xee had us try. Xee's Mom was dressed in traditional Hmong clothing and laid to rest in the middle of the room. They had big drums playing to begin to open the portal to heaven for her and they played music from these wooden instruments. Man I wish I could explain all this better. It was really such a neat experience, we were the only non-Hmong people there, but everyone was so kind to us!<br/><br/>Well that's all I have time for... ha when I get home I just have so many stories for you! Glad to hear you had fun celebrating Father's Day and that Dan had a good birthday as well(: It was hard to be away, but I am so grateful for the opportunity to serve. I know this is where I need to be right now and I've been so blessed to feel the Savior lifting me time and time again out here. This week we were able to have a special fast and I just have such a strong testimony that our Father in Heaven is aware of each of us! Love and miss you guys, hope you have a great week!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>This week was soo good! It was so fun to see the miracles happening in Wisconsin and in Michigan!<br/><br/>Zone Training Meeting:<br/>Yay for the Green Bay South Zone! It was so fun to get together with everyone this week. Sister Pope and I worked with the Zone Leaders, Elders Crandall and Wiscombe, to prep everything for the meeting and it all came together nicely. I really liked the training we did on using the Book of Mormon more effectively as a finding tool. Sister Pope and I learned a ton preparing the training and have been focusing on testifying of the power of the Book of Mormon to everyone we talk to. We met this young mom named Ashley who accepted a copy of the Book of Mormon and is eager to read from it! She is Oneida so she grew up hearing the Oneida spiritual stories, but was raised Lutheran so she has a Christian background as well. When we explained that the Book of Mormon is a record of God's dealings with the people in the Americas<br/>she got super excited and asked if Christ ever taught the people in the Americas. AHHH we were like 'yes! it talks about it here in 3 Nephi 11...' ha it was so so great. She grew up hearing of a great prophet who had brought peace to her people and she had always thought this was Christ! She is seriously so prepared. We are excited to begin teaching her!<br/><br/>Lessons with Lori:<br/>After every lesson with Lori, Sister Pope and I leave so happy(: Lori is progressing really well and is developing a strong testimony. This week we were finally able to set a solid baptismal date with her for July 25th! We still have a lot to teach her, but already she has noticed how the gospel is changing her life. She recognizes that it brings her so much peace and happiness. I have loved seeing the change in her these past few weeks. She had plans to come to church this week and we had all her fellow-shippers lined up, but she fell and hurt her back super bad and couldn't make it): We were able to talk with her on the phone last night though and she seems to be doing a bit better - keep her in your prayers!<br/><br/>Right Place, Right Time Miracle:<br/>The other day we had an appointment cancel so we were heading back to the apartment to do our weekly planning, but we had the thought to stop by a less active in the area first. We've tried to stop by Stephanie's house a few times, but she works a ton and we don't find her at home very much. So anyway we stop by and knock on the door and Stephanie answers and was like, 'NO WAY!' then she started freaking out... So moments before we knocked on the door Stephanie had been on the phone with her Mom (who is active in Appleton) explaining that she was really struggling and her Mom had suggested that she reach out to the missionaries. The moment her Mom suggested that, we knocked on the door! So yeah then we were all freaking out and we had a lesson and set an appointment to come back and see them in a few days(:<br/><br/>Blitz in Marquette:<br/>Instead of exchanging with the Sister Woods and Sister Payne in Marquette we went up and blitzed their area (meaning Sister Pope and I both stayed and worked in Marquette). We drove about 3.5 hours to get there then stayed for the 24 hour exchange and drove back home. It was such a gorgeous drive! Everything is SOO green and we got to drive along the lake shore so the view was incredible. We took some pictures of Lake Superieor and Lake Michigan so I will send those(: Wisconsin is beautiful, but the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is breathtaking! There are more rolling hills up there and the colors are super intense. I loved being there in the summer, but I imagine the winter is just brutal. Anyway the blitz went really well. I got to exchange with Sister Payne, she's from Montana and has been out for 6 months. She is awesome. We worked hard and saw miracles as we talked with the yoopers. Ha some of them sure do talk funny, Sister Payne and I<br/>laughed a ton! I learned a lot about listening to the spirit while I was with her too. She's super in tune. While we were up there we had a BBQ outside with Elders Williams and Ward and a member family, it was so much fun!<br/><br/>We got the transfer info this week and... Sister Pope and I are staying together in Green Bay! We are SO excited we have another transfer together and that we get to work with so many amazing sisters(: This transfer things seem to be changing a lot in the mission. They've combined a couple zones and we have a bunch of sisters coming out. Of the 6 sisters we exchange with, 4 of them will be training! It is crazy to be on the 'older' end of the mission. I am really excited about the work going on here, it is so fun to exchange and see the miracles happening in other areas as well. I know this is Heavenly Father's work and I am so grateful for the chance to be a little part of it!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>CONGRATS ZACH!!! So glad to hear graduation stuff went well this week(: Things up here have been pretty busy. I am really excited about our investigator Lori. She is progressing like crazy! We had this really powerful church tour lesson with her and talked about Baptism and the Sacrament. She prayed aloud with us for the first time in years, it was probably one of the most spirit filled lessons of my mission. Such a special experience.<br/><br/>Service:<br/>We had a whole bunch of service opportunities this week with ward members and a few potentials! Ha we spent most of our P-day last week helping the Pyper family get settled into their new place and then we helped the Bishop family move in the following day. They are both super solid families. We are looking forward to getting to know them and involving them in the work! We also had the chance to help some of Bishop Millet's friends clean their windows! We also helped the YW with a rummage sale service project and helped Sister Wozniak pack things up for her move. Oh and we did yard work for Sister Robertson's neighbor Leslie and were able to talk with her about the church afterwards! So solid.<br/><br/>Exchange in Sheboygan:<br/>Got to go on exchanges with Sister Carlini in Sheboygan! She has been out for 5 weeks now and is already such a powerful teacher and really loves the people. We had a great time together and met this cute Mom and son... new investigators! Also we ran out to this beautiful lighthouse for our work out in the morning and took tons of pictures. Sheboygan is gorgeous!<br/><br/>Mission Leadership Council:<br/>The highlight of MLC was getting to see Sister King! Oh how I love that girl!!! We were able to talk a ton and catch up(: Then President and Sister Cutler presented these super good trainings about faith, using the Book of Mormon app, and working with the members. I LOVED Sister Cutler's faith training - it was just what I needed. Helped me understand that faith has two parts, action (what we do) and power (what God does). We will present a training on it next week - I'm excited to study this idea out more to prepare!<br/><br/>This week we've got Zone Training Meeting which we're in charge of with the Zone Leaders and then a blitz with the Marquette Sisters - should be a lot of fun! Hope Uncle Allen's wedding and Nate's Homecoming go well, can't wait to hear about them(: Love you!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><h1>Older and Wiser Too?</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-61362509882949783" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>Things are good. And insane. I don't think I have ever been so exhausted in my whole life or so happy!<br/><br/>Double Exchanges:<br/>It seemed like I was hardly with Sister Pope at all this week because we had double exchanges with Green Bay 1st Ward (Sisters Packer and Larsen) and Manitowoc (Sisters Lyons and Kealer)! I loved spending time with Sister Packer - she is absolutely wonderful! We were in the same YSA ward in Provo during fall semester so we knew each other before the mission, but we hadn't served near each other until I got transferred up here to Green Bay. Now we get to see each other all the time which is a blast! She is such a hard worker and full of charity. We saw success as we contacted this headquarter referral together and tracted out this quite neighborhood. Also we just talked and talked and talked which was just fun - love her(: Then I got to go on exchanges with Sister Lyons in Manitowoc! It was a beautiful drive out there. It is SOOO green here and there are all these rolling hills and red barnyards every few miles. It is gorgeous. But yeah the exchange was good. Sister Lyons and I went to a Relief Society activity in their ward and learned to make Spring Rolls! Then the next day we had this super huge miracle happen as we were out tracting - we found this solid mother and taught her for an hour outside and committed her to take the lessons! Her little girl was adorable, she kept picking flowers for us as we talked(:<br/><br/>Zone Conference:<br/>The Marquette Sisters (Sisters Woods and Payne) stayed the night with us Wednesday so we could all drive to Zone Conference together on Thursday. Sister Woods and I were both celebrating our birthdays Thursday so it was fun to be together(: Zone Conference was great - it is always so fun to see everyone and catch up! Everyone sang 'happy birthday' to Sister Woods and I during lunch and we got to take pictures. Sister Pope, Elder Crandal, Elder Wiscombe and I gave our training on Jacob 5 and it went really well. The Stake President and his wife both spoke about the importance of loving those we serve and remembering to listen. Then President and Sister Cutler presented training on the importance of keeping the Sabbath Day holy and helping families to progress in the gospel. It was such a good meeting, made me excited to change the way I teach investigators about observing the<br/>Sabbath. Oh and at Zone Conferences Brother Barley always inspects the mission cars and rewards the companionship who has the cleanest car with a gift card. Sister Pope and I totally won. #success<br/><br/>I don't have enough time to really explain anything else, but we are doing good and seeing good things happen. Elder Perry's passing is sad, but we had a chance to reread his last conference talk and are grateful for his service. Brother Mills was released as ward mission leader and we are all crushed - he is amazing, we are so grateful for his service. We are excited for the new guy though. Should be good. Oh and my birthday was a blast!<br/><br/>Thanks for the thoughtful gifts and birthday wishes this week! I sure do love you guys!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:

</div><h1>Lori's Baptism!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-2547512992203183408" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>We checked the transfer board this morning and I'm staying in Green Bay! Sister Pope is headed home and I'll be teaching Sister Elkington the ropes of STL life. Sister Elkington has served the past 5 transfers in Wisconsin Rapids (where I was trained) so I am super excited to ask her how everyone is doing!<br/><br/>Sister Monroe Moment:<br/>There was a bit of a mix up with miles for the car this month so we've been walking, getting rides with members, busing, and biking a lot this week! The ward members have been so helpful, we are so grateful! A couple of members loaned us bikes to use so we had a fun time trying to figure out how to bike in skirts. We were riding through an intersection and I had a bit of a Marilyn Monroe moment as my skirt flew up! Ha good times. It was great to be back on the buses again, but Green Bay just doesn't have the same caliber of a metro system as Madison does.<br/><br/>Blitzing Sheboygan:<br/>The APs had us blitz Sheboygan instead of exchanging because we were short on miles this transfer. It was fun to spend the night with Sister Carlini and Sister Wilson in beautiful Sheboygan. Sister Wilson and I had a great day together! I was so grateful to spend time with her and learn from her Christ-like example. As we went out to contact on the pier we had lessons with this a young Hmong guy, a Muslim family from Syria, an athiest old man, and a very Christian couple who were having basically the worst day of their lives (he had lost his job and she'd lost her wallet and they had just moved to Sheboygan so they were living out of their car and yet they were sitting by the pier enjoying the beautiful view and talking about what to do) anyway we had lessons with all of these VERY different people and the gospel had perfect relevance for each of them. I love the gospel!!!<br/><br/>The Right Door:<br/>We had this huge miracle this week as we went out with Sister Ross to try to track down one of the missing less active young women in the ward. We had an address for the apartment complex she was staying at, but not the right apartment number. There were hundreds of apartments, but we truly were guided by the spirit and knocked the right door and she was there! SUCH A MIRACLE!<br/><br/>The Burning:<br/>To celebrate Sister Pope's mission we had a big bonfire with the Vanderhyden's where she lit an outfit of hers on fire! It was super sweet! It has been so fun to hear all her mission stories the last few months and to learn from her testimony and example. Sister Pope loves the Book of Mormon and does a great job of instilling that love in the hearts of those she teaches. I have learned a lot from her and will miss her a bunch! Going home seems to be such a bittersweet thing. There have been so many tender mercies the past transfer and to end with Lori's baptism really meant a lot to Sister Pope. I am so grateful for the chance I've had to serve with her(:<br/><br/>Lori's Baptism:<br/>This week we finished up teaching Lori about the Priesthood and enduring to the end. She was so prepared for her baptism. Unfortunately her husband, who has been supportive this entire time, decided not to attend the baptismal service or her confirmation. This was hard on Lori, but she said she couldn't deny what she knew and that she knew she needed to be baptized. She has so much faith! We had an incredible lesson in the chapel the night before her baptism and that same spirit was there during the service the next day. The service was such an amazing experience - one of those moments when the spirit is so strong you don't want to move! I didn't want that moment to ever end. After she was baptized Lori was super happy and said she had butterflies in her heart because of the spirit, ha so cute! Her confirmation the next day was equally beautiful and she prayed at the end of Relief Society, it is amazing to see how much she has changed!<br/><br/>Book Club Murder Mystery:<br/>We also had the best Book of Mormon book club EVER last night as we read and discussed Helaman 8 and 9 with Jamie, Angie, and the GB1 Sisters. Jamie put a ton of work into organizing it into a murder mystery where we all played different parts and had to figure out who had murdered the chief judge! The party was equip with Book of Mormon treats and disguises - we sure had a fun time(:<br/><br/>In other news.. we had a fun breakfast appointment with Sister Winchester where she treated us to iHop and drove us clear out to Denmark for a solid lesson with our investigator Nicole after that. Nicole is a young Mom we are trying to meet more regularly with, but she lives super far from us. We had a great lesson together though and hope to set a date with her! The Stake Picnic was also this week so we got to go to that with Jamie and then Lori and a bunch of the ward members came too! It turned out well and we had fun playing frisbee.<br/><br/>Things are going well out here. There are ups and downs, but I remember the ups way more than the downs and feel the lifting power of the Atonement help me through each day. Love and miss you!<br/>xoxo,<br/>Sister Kelley(:<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><h1>Death Week</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-2022899148547998250" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>This week was absolutely exhausting. After we finished our third and final exchange Sister Pope and I high-fived each other and celebrated surviving our death week! It was so fun to spend time with the Sisters and do our best to strengthen and uplift them, but it has been hard to stay up on things in our own area because we were gone so much! We're both feeling rather behind and a bit stressed about all the planning and catching up we've got to do, but we're excited for the great week ahead of us! Lori had her baptismal interview yesterday and all things are go for her baptism on Saturday, we are thrilled(:<br/><br/>Exchanges in Marquette:<br/>We spent two nights in Michigan this week blitzing with Sisters Payne and Twitchell. It was fun to get to know Sister Twitchell who is being trained and to be with Sister Payne again. Sister Payne and I practiced street contacting and saw tons of success! We taught a man named Craig outside for almost an hour and by the end of our lesson he was in tears! Then a member invited us to lunch with her non-member friends at Lake Superior so we talked with them and enjoyed beach contacting, it was soo pretty! Then we had a bit of a downer because this solid lady we'd found on our last exchange together (who the sisters have been teaching for a month or so) dropped us with a note outside the door. Ughh. All in all it was a great exchange though(: Sister Payne and I had a great comp study talking about charity and how Christ showed love to those He taught. On the 3 and a half hour drive back from Marquette Sister Pope and I took a pit stop at Seguins cheese shop where we enjoyed some yummy chocolate cheese!<br/><br/>Exchanges with Appleton:<br/>We finished exchanges with Marquette, worked in our area for a couple hours then headed out to exchange with Appleton. Sister Rousseau came back to work here in Green Bay with me and Sister Pope went with Sister Trent. Sister Rousseau goes home with Sister Pope and she is such a powerful missionary! She is super bold and works hard, we had a great day together. Sister Rau, a member in the ward, drove us out to Denmark (part of our area we don't get to go to much because of our miles limitations) where we met with some less actives and a potential investigator. Later we were out tracting and we met Crystal, a cute young Mom who was very receptive. We have a return appointment set this week to meet with her and her Jewish husband. Then we were about to drive away from our dinner appointment, but we saw this guy so Sister Rousseau talked with him while directing me as I backed out (yay for missionary backing rules!) and she invited him to take a tour of the church right then and there! He agreed and we had a sweet little lesson!<br/><br/>Exchanges in Winnebago YSA:<br/>After Appleton we exchanged with the Winnebago YSA Sisters. Sisters Lamprecht and Gifford are great(: I went with Sister Gifford and worked in their area. We went to the Saturday morning Farmers Market and street contacting into some really solid people! We met this cute YSA named Kylie who is actually moving to Utah in a couple weeks to finish up with her Masters at Utah State. We talked with her for a while and gave her a copy of the Book of Mormon, she'll get baptized for sure. Then we had a few other lessons throughout the day, one with a Hmong investigator they have named Alvin. He's a funny guy. Also had one of those right place right time moments when we stopped by a less active, Heavenly Father is so mindful of each of us!<br/><br/>In other news we got our car fixed (it had some recall issues) and our AC fixed so we are no longer sweating to death. Oh and I tried this new Hmong food called kapong (sp?) and it was super spicy, but delicious! We've got a good week ahead of us, keep Lori in your prayers! Love and miss ya!<br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>Jamie's Baptism!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-6027296344316297419" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/>
<br/>
This week was busy with baptism prep! We scrubbed out the font, finalized program plans/outline, practiced for our special musical number with the other sisters, hunted down a baptismal suit, etc. There were 3 baptisms on Saturday and everything went well pulling it all together! Jamie's baptism ran smoothly and the spirit was really strong. The two sisters who began teaching her flew in to support her which was really special. Sister Arnold and Sister Brandley are amazing and we had fun getting to know them(: After Jamie was baptized she couldn't stop smiling and kept talking about how she felt 'grounded' and that she had a clearer sense of purpose. Ahh such a great day! It has been such an amazing opportunity to work with Jamie and learn from her testimony the past couple months. I love how the gospel changes people and helps us each become better! It is so fun to see that process up close as a missionary(: Anyway Jamie's then her confirmation was yesterday and she shared her testimony in Relief Society(: After Jamie was confirmed Lori leaned over to us and said, "That was AWESOME!" ha she is looking forward to her baptism in a few weeks(:<br/>
<br/>
Zone Training Meeting:<br/>
The Marquette sisters got to stay the night with us before ZTM which was a blast(: Then ZTM turned out really well. Sister Pope and I did a training on how to use the Book of Mormon more effectively by 1) Improving how we introduce the Book of Mormon 2) Improving how we use the Book of Mormon to teach gospel principles 3) Improving how we use the Book of Mormon in following up. We were pleased with how it turned out and Elder Wiscombe and Elder Teeples did a great job with their training on Christ-like attributes and becoming. We gave the zone a planner insert with the ZTM commitments on it and Peanut Butter bars so everyone seemed happy(:<br/>
<br/>
Exchanges with Manitowoc:<br/>
After Zone Training Meeting we exchanged with Sister Lyons and Sister Peterson. Sister Peterson and I spent the exchange in Manitowoc and saw some pretty sweet miracles! We had a powerful lesson with the Multens, a less active family who are starting to come back and are working on getting to the temple. Brother Multen was excited to tell us about/show off his boat so we related it to the gospel and it worked like a charm! I love that everything relates back to the gospel somehow. Then we taught a lesson to a man Sister Pope and I had met a few days ago, but who actually lives just outside of Manitowoc. His name is Jorge and he has such a sincere desire to change his life and<br/>
come to Christ. He speaks a decent amount of English and Sister Peterson and I knew enough Spanish to teach a lesson. The spirit was way strong and we even set a baptismal date with him in Spanish! It was totally lead by the spirit and such a sweet miracle! Also Sister Peterson is super sweet and really has her scriptures down.<br/>
<br/>
12 Days of Baptism Part 2:<br/>
Finished the baptism countdown for our investigator Jamie this week. She loved all the little surprises we left - it was a great way for us to stay in daily contact despite her crazy work schedule!<br/>
5) Glow Stick door decor - 1 Nephi 17:13 'I Will Be Your Light in the Wilderness'<br/>
4) Peanut Butter Bars - John 16:33<br/>
3) Rainbow fish/fishing net - 1 Nephi 1:12 'Caught Up in a Good Read' Jamie received her first copy of the Book of Mormon one year ago on this day!<br/>
2) Avengers Puzzle - The Gospel is MARVELous<br/>
1) Kool-Aid - 'Ohh yeah!'<br/>
<div>
<br/>
Jamie has always joked that once she joined the church and was baptized she would be 'drinking the Kool-Aid' so we decorated her door with Kool-Aid packets on the last night and served Kool-Aid after her baptism for refreshments(:<br/>
<br/>
Spider Hunting:<br/>
A lady in the ward called us in a panic this week needing some help killing spiders. We went over to her home and there were SO many spiders. Like hundreds would not even be an exaggeration. They were the nasty daddy long leg type and their webs covered the place! At first we were freaked out, but then we got a system down and whipped it out. I would sweep the spiders down from the wall and ceiling then Sister Pope would vacuum them up! Ha we made and epic video you'll get to see one day(:<br/>
<br/>
Interviews:<br/>
We had interviews with President Cutler this week - he always seems to know just what we all need(: In preparation for interviews we studied about fasting and prayer. I learned a lot about fasting and feel like it has really helped me develop charity as I fast for the needs of others. We talked about Isaiah 58 and Elder Eyring's past conference talk. President gave me some really great counsel of how best to help the sisters we work with and encouraged me to keep strengthening my own hope and faith in the Savior. Then after interviews with President we got to chat with Sister Cutler and she even came out and worked with Sister Pope and I for the night. We had some good lessons and<br/>
enjoyed time with her.<br/>
<br/>
Well that's all I've got time for! We have a busy week scheduled this week with 3 exchanges and prepping for Lori's baptism on the 25th! Thanks for all the prayers and support. Love and miss you!<br/>
<br/>
xoxo,<br/>

</div><h1>Happy 4th(:</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-2545524365380730028" itemprop="description articleBody">
Hey fam and friends,<br/>
<br/>
Hope all is well and that you had a wonderful 4th of July! How lucky are we to live in this country?! I am so grateful for the freedoms we enjoy, especially the freedom of religion and that we can worship how we please. It is incredible how much went into preparing the way for the Restoration. On Saturday we taught a few lessons using 1 Nephi 13 to explain how God prepared for the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. Mama B had us and the GB1 Sisters over for BBQ ribs and strawberry shortcake and later that night Jamie made us dinner! We were spoiled! We had some fun lessons as we were out and about, even met a cute family. On the drive home over the bridge we got to see the<br/>
sky light up with fireworks and then our neighbors had a firework show we enjoyed from our apartment window.<br/>
<br/>
12 Days of Baptism:<br/>
This past week we started a baptism countdown for our investigator Jamie. Each day for the 12 days leading up to her baptism we've been dropping off little gifts and scripture jokes to help her feel loved(: Sister Pope and I think we're hilarious so hopefully some of these make sense, I'll share the ones we have left so far...<br/>
12) Minion door decor 'You're one in a MINION' (:<br/>
11) Hand Clapper - Mosiah 18:6-11 'they clapped their hands for joy and exclaimed [baptism] is the desire of our hearts!' (when everybody wants to get baptized at the waters of Mormon)<br/>
10) M&amp;Ms - Malachi 3:10 'Blessings of heaven POURED out'<br/>
9) Mustache/glasses Disguise - Mosiah 12:1 'Abinadi came among them in disguise'... but gives away his identity!<br/>
8) Pretzel Rods - 1 Nephi 8:30 Iron Rod<br/>
7) Salt Grinder - 3 Nephi 12:13 covenant keepers are compared to salt, keep your covenants #staysalty<br/>
6) Air Freshener - Alma 19:6 'to me he doth not stink' (Lamoni's wife)<br/>
<br/>
<div>
So yeah we have more to come and Saturday is Jamie's big day! Keep her in your prayers this week(: We got her baptismal interview done so now we're just finalizing stuff with the program, should be good!<br/>
<br/>
Exchanges with Green Bay 1:<br/>
I got to go on exchanges with Sister Wright and Sister Pope went with Sister Packer. I absolutely love these sisters and was grateful for the chance to get to know Sister Wright. She is being trained right<br/>
now, so she's just starting out as a missionary. I was really impressed by how strong the spirit was when she testified. We got a couple solid new investigators as we taught and testified of the Book of Mormon. We also met a few crazies, but the quote of the day was when we invited this man to church and he replied 'I don't do church, I do speed.' Poor guy!<br/>
<br/>
Mission Leadership Council:<br/>
Drove to Oshkosh for MLC and got to see Sister King! It was the last time I will see her until after the mish because she goes home this month. Aww it was bitter sweet as we talked and reminisced, I sure love her! It was also great to see everyone and President and Sister Cutler(: They presented a really powerful Christlike attribute training and invited us to read Elder Oak's talk 'The Challenge to<br/>
Become.' It is such a good talk, I highly recommend it. I also really liked that they shared Mark 1:16-18 where Christ invites, 'come and I will make you to BECOME fishers of men' it truly is a becoming<br/>
process. A process of progression and true progression is true repentance. I am looking forward to presenting these trainings at Zone Training Meting this week.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we had the chance to fast as a mission for 'the souls of those who knew not God.' (Alma 6:6) It was powerful to join together as a mission, we are working hard to meet our goals! I am so grateful for the year I've been able to serve so far and am excited for the next 6 months. The time is flying by, crazy to think last 4th of July I was in the MTC! I love being able to testify of a loving Heavenly Father and of the Living Christ! Love and miss you guys!<br/>
xoxo,<br/>

Hey everyone! Hope you all are doing well!(:<br/><br/>We have been sooo blessed here in Green Bay! Seriously so many good things are going on and we couldn't be more grateful. We had Mission Leadership Council in Oshkosh this week so we were able to meet together representing the mission and talk about the many miracles we've been seeing! We had a sweet training about using Family Home Evening as a member missionary work opportunity and another training on learning to recognize the promptings of the Spirit more fully. As always it was great to see President and Sister Cutler and all of our mission friends(:<br/><br/>Looking for a Church:<br/>So the other day Sister Elkington and I were about to leave an area that we were in when we got a call from a member wanting us to stop over at their house. We decided the best use of our time before we stopped over at their house was to tract a couple of doors. We knock on the door of this house and this guy walks out and before we can even say who we are he says "I've been looking for a church. Do you have any suggestions?" ... (: Sister Elkington and I looked at each other and were like yes, yes we do(: Afterwards we were chatting about it, and we just realized how much Heavenly Father plays a role in missionary work! If Brother Holcombe hadn't called at that moment we would've left that area to go work somewhere else and we wouldn't have met Ryan when we did. The Lord is in the details of His work!<br/><br/>Appleton Exchange:<br/>Got to spend time with Sister Rosenblum on exchanges in Appleton - she's from Tennesse and has such a sassy Southern attitude, we had a lot of fun together! We met with this cute young Mom named Stacie and her daughter Lexi. We were able to get Lexi to YW and she loved it! Also met and found a few new investigators for them. All good things. Sister Elkington and Sister Trent saw miracles here as they got in contact with an investigator who was MIA.<br/><br/>The Grunden Family:<br/>Highlight of the week was definitely the fact that the Grunden family got sealed!!! How grateful I am for the Priesthood power on the earth again - this power that binds families together and brings lasting happiness! Sister Elkington and I are both so grateful to know their family and to see how the gospel has changed and blessed them. ETERNAL LIFE IS FAMILY LIFE!<br/><br/>Sacred Sabbath:<br/>We just had the most stellar Sabbath day yesterday! Our investigator Ashley and her husband Gabriel, and their 5 kids came to church and stayed all three hours! The ward fellowshipped them so well and really helped them feel loved. Gunnar and Alexa (recently returned missionaries / future newly weds in the ward) helped keep the kids quiet. It has been such blessing having them around the last few weeks to help with lessons! They are getting married on Friday! Anyway Ashley, Gabriel, and the kids all had a great time at church, they are doing so well(: Then Mariah was there as well and she is really starting to open up to us, she is such a sweet heart! She went to Bishopric Youth Discussion with Charley and some of the other YM/YW and really seemed to have a good time. Then Lori and Jamie were there and Bishop taught an incredible 5th Sunday lesson on keeping the Sabbath Day Holy. We've been sharing a fun FHE with people using ice cream Sundaes and putting different toppings on our Sundaes (i.e. ketchup is good, but not on a Sundae! So we had little labels like shopping is good, but not on a Sunday!) Not sure if that makes sense, but it is a cute object lesson that seems to get the point across and make everyone happy(: I am grateful for Sundays - for the spiritual recharge and the chance to partake of the Sacrament and recommit to do a little better each week.<br/><br/>Well that's all we've got time for, so many good things! Hope you all have a good week as school starts up and the leaves start to change(: I am so excited for Wisconsin fall! Wisconsin winter... ehhh not so much... But fall, fall is good(: This week is Sister Elkington's last one in the mission, it will be hard to say goodbye to her. This transfer together has gone by way too fast! She is such a consecrated<br/>missionary, I've learned a ton from her. Her positive attitude is contagious and we're always laughing(: We find out about transfers on Saturday and because of Labor Day we'll have P-day on Tuesday, so I'll write to you then! LOVE YOU!!!!!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><h1>Say yah to the U.P. eh?</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-6870714921678092802" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/>
<br/>
We had a wonderful week and to top if off we had an incredible Ward Conference yesterday! Ward council was such a spiritual experience. Seriously this ward is so great! Ward Conference was all about reaching out in service and love to those around us. It was one of those meetings where everything that was shared seemed to be exactly what I needed(:<br/>
<br/>
What We've Been Up To:<br/>
We are so excited to be teaching Mariah, she is such a sweetheart! She is the 12 year-old grand daughter of a less active in the ward. She went to girls camp earlier this summer and after that started coming to church and meeting with us! We had a great lesson with her where we taught the Plan of Salvation and testified about what it meant for us and our families while showing a picture of our family. It was fun for her to see what our families look like and ask about each of you - I am grateful we can be together for eternity! We had some solid lessons with our investigator Ashley this week as well. She wasn't able to make it to church yesterday though so we're super bummed): We met a couple cute young Moms as we were out finding - we are looking forward to return appointments with them this week. One of the GB1 Elder's investigators got baptized this week, he is 13 and his name is Sonny. He's been studying with them since I got here so it has been fun to watch him progress. Sonny is so great, it was a super happy day for them all(: Then last night we had a sweet lesson with Jamie, Angie, the Mills, and Sister Yang. Sister Yang (a semi-recently returned less active Hmong sister) is one of Jamie's visiting teachers and she taught the Gospel of Jesus Christ new member lesson!  Having the visiting teachers involved in/teaching the new member lessons has been so nice! It is much better than us teaching them, it really unites the ward members and recent converts!<br/>
<br/>
Marquette Blitz:<br/>
Oh another thing we did this week was drive 4 hours up to Marquette to blitz! It was a long drive, but we got there in one piece and made it back okay too! On the way we stopped at a little cheese shop and got cheap UP shirts - they are great, I'll have to take a picture and send it later! It was great to spend time with Sister Payne and Sister Twitchell. It was fun to realize we were all at different points in our missions - Sister Twitchell 1/4 of the way Sister Payne 1/2 way, I'm about 3/4 of the way, and then Sister Elkington about to go home. We talked and shared experiences together, love those sisters! Then the next day while in downtown Marquette, Sister Twitchell and I met this cute non-member couple who have a nephew currently serving a mission. We chatted with them and asked if they liked reading his weekly emails. They commented about how his emails seemed 'too happy' like everything about missionary work was sunshine and wildflowers all the time. They said it was hard to relate to because in real life we have ups and downs, sometimes we struggle. Now I'm sure this dear Elder has had plenty of struggles and that he is good about writing home and sharing the good experiences, but I wanted to let you all know if I haven't already, missions are tough! It's a lot of hard work. There is disappointment, rejection, fear. BUT it is soo worth it! Sister Twitchell and I were able to talk together about the different ups and downs we've had and the stretching we've undergone. It is so incredible how these experiences mold us and help us become who Heavenly Father knows we can and wants us to become. I am so grateful to be a missionary through the ups and downs!<br/>
<br/>
Grateful for Green Bay:<br/>
Words cannot even express how  incredibly grateful I am to be serving here in Green Bay! It has been such a blessing to work in this area - there are great places to talk to families, a good number of the people we tract into are kind enough to talk with us, we can refer Spanish and Hmong speakers to the local Elders, I have an incredibly diligent and hard working companion, the members are willing to have us in their homes and want to do missionary work, the ward does a good job of fellowshipping, many of the Relief Society ladies are willing to come to lessons with us, our ward mission leader is trying hard to learn and fulfill his calling, we have a fabulous ward council, the Bishopric is genuinely concerned about the needs of individual ward members, the Stake Presidency has an awesome vision for missionary work, etc., etc., etc. This area has all the tools to have BOOMING missionary work go on and I sometimes feel discouraged that my own inadequacies, shortcomings, and struggles slow things down. As I go on exchanges with the Sisters and see some dysfunctional situations I wonder why Heavenly Father has blessed me so much to be serving here in Green Bay 2. I just hope I can serve in the way He wants me to and be a part of fulfilling Elder Martino's statement that GREEN BAY IS GOING TO GROW! I want to have the type of faith that Preach My Gospel talks about - faith to make good things happen in my own life and in the lives of others, but I feel pretty helpless on my own. That's when I'm reminded it goes back to developing stronger faith in the Savior. The Atonement study we're doing as a mission is really helping me with that. I am grateful for the enabling power, for the lifting I feel when I turn to Christ. I know He lives!<br/>
<br/>
Peckham Surprise:<br/>
Last thing real quick, the Peckham family from Wisconsin Rapids drove up to Green Bay yesterday to attend Sacrament meeting with Sister Elkington and I! It was so fun to see them again after so long! We visited and had fun catching up - love them!<br/>
<br/>
Glad you got to go to Sister Pope's Homecoming as a family, isn't she great?! Also glad to hear everything went well for moving Zach out, can't believe he's starting college! Love and miss you!<br/>
<br/>
xoxo,<br/>

</div><h1>Double Exchange</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7912884053119453177" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>The time is literally flying by out here, seriously since when is it August? Sister Elkington and I just go as hard as we can everyday! It's been such a blessing to be serving with her(:<br/><br/>P-day:<br/>Since I never really explain what we do on P-days I just want to take a minute and write about what we've been up to today! This morning we woke up and ran as usual then had studies. We did our laundry, cleaned our apartment, and made homemade bread (it didn't turn out like yours Mom, but I tried). Then we toured Lambeau field with Sister Wright and Sister Adams-Hart. It is starting to get busy here in Green Bay as the Packers prep for the season and today they had practice so there were tons of people there to watch! The practice field is right across from the stadium so traffic was backed up a ton. All the locals say this is just the beginning of the madness... I am excited to see the town come alive! Now if only we could help these people be as passionate about the gospel as they are about their Packers...(: It was fun to hear the history of the team and run through the tunnel out onto the field. We had a great time and grabbed lunch together after. Then grocery shopping at Aldi - this great cheap little place where you can get loads of produce! We ran into Dianetha from the first ward who recently returned from serving her mission in Kennewick, WA - turns out she knows Rebecca Little! We had fun chatting and took a picture(: Then to the church to email and in a bit we have dinner with the Mill's and FHE at the Ross's with our investigator Mariah!<br/><br/>Exchanges with Sheboygan:<br/>Sheboygan, Wisconsin is seriously SO beautiful. Look it up! For our workout we ran along the board walk and beach bare foot. It was divine(: It was so fun to work with Sister Carlini again (Sister Elkington was with Sister Strait) and see how much she has grown in the last couple transfers. She is such a people person(: We taught two really powerful back to back lessons about the Plan of Salvation with some solid investigators. I taught the Plan of Salvation a lot this week and was able to spend time thinking about and studying it. I am so grateful for a loving Heavenly Father who has a plan for each of us. His Plan truly is a plan for our happiness! I know the Savior is central to this plan and makes salvation possible!<br/><br/>Exchanges with Green Bay 1:<br/>We had two exchanges this week which is a bit exhausting, but also so much fun! I love the Sisters out here so much! I got to be with Sister Wright for the exchange while Sister Elkington was with Sister Adams-Hart. We were able to teach a lot of really solid other lessons together. Sister Wright is great at setting goals that make us stretch! She can also teach from the scriptures super powerfully! We had a great lesson with a part member family, the Bairds. The spirit was so strong their 9 year old son Talon said, "I feel so happy and warm right now!" It was the best thing(:<br/><br/>Green Bay Stake Conference:<br/>The mission has definitely taught me to love Stake Conference, especially the Saturday night session! I felt like I received so many answers to my questions and guidance from Heavenly Father. They talked about observing the Sabbath day and the importance of ward,couple, and family councils. They talked about ministering to others like the Savior did. I loved that they put an emphasis on ministering to the individual. I know Heavenly Father is so mindful of each one of us and that we can have personal relationships with Him and our Savior. The spirit was especially strong as Sister Fischer sang 'Savior Redeemer of My Soul' I never wanted to leave that pew. Ah so good. Then the<br/>Sunday session was great as well. Especially because our investigator Ashley and her husband and kids came!!! The kids were little angels and everyone fellow-shipped them really well! I am so excited about her! Oh and the Stake President's daughter returned from her mission in New Zealand late Saturday night so it was fun to see their family reunited, the Jones's are such wonderful people. I am constantly in awe of how much the saints sacrifice out here to live the gospel. Many of them traveled hours to be at Stake Conference, what incredible examples!<br/><br/>Hope you all have a good week - it was so fun to see the pictures of you at the temple with Sister King and Kendall! AH! LOVE THEM! Good luck getting Zach all moved out! Love and miss ya! Be good.... for once!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<br/><br/>P.S. Sorry for no pictures lately! I have to get a new memory card due to some technical difficulties... ha we tried to get one when we were shopping today, but the power went out because of the rain and they couldn't ring us up! Hopefully next week!

</div><h1>Growth in Green Bay</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-3183261171754033331" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/>
<br/>
AHHHH I just love that you got to go to Sister King's Homecoming, isn't she THE ABSOLUTE BEST?! And you met Kendall?! Aw man I love them SO SO much! I was also happy to hear Zach survived his surgery - pretty sure I was way more swollen than that though! Sounds like your week was jam packed! Ours was busy too, so many good things!<br/>
<br/>
Green Bay Zone Conference:<br/>
The Marquette Sisters got to stay the night with us before Zone Conference which is always a blast(: Then randomly we didn't have to present a training so it was a nice relaxing meeting for us! As always it was great to see President and Sister Cutler, they both gave inspiring trainings. President asked for a volunteer and had Elder Baldwin eat a snickers bar in front of everyone. He pointed out the phrase on the wrapper: Snickers - Satisfies. He asked Elder Baldwin if he felt satisfied after eating the Snickers bar and he said that he did. President then went on and asked him to eat 4 more Snickers bars one at a time. Ha poor Elder Baldwin was dying by the end, but President made his point. Snickers don't satisfy. He went on to teach about what brings true satisfaction. He expounded Lehi's dream and blew our minds. Ha being on the path working toward eternal life, family life, is what brings true happiness and satisfaction in this life and the life to come.<br/>
<br/>
Lesson Highlights:<br/>
This week we had an object lesson with Jamie using s'mores - we talked about what we can do to have s'more and s'more of the spirit in our lives. It was a bit sticky, but a fun lesson nonetheless. Later in the week Jamie came to an appointment with us - she is such a great member already(: In other good news, we got back into contact with Ashley and had a powerful lesson with her. She opened up to us a lot and talked about how she has noticed a different feeling in her home when we come over. She said when we leave that feeling leaves, but she doesn't want it to ever leave! We explained about the spirit and invited her to be baptized. She is now working towards a date. Then there is Sharon, a less active lady we found and have been working with. She is wonderful! This week we asked if she was ready to come back to church. She said she had been thinking about pulling her skirts back out... (: We are taking Sister Vanderhyden to a lesson with her this week so we hope with that friendship she'll have the courage to come back into full activity! Then we just began teaching Mariah, the grand daughter of a less active lady in the ward. Mariah went to Girls Camp a month or so ago and loved it! She has been coming to church and wants to learn more. We are involving the YW with her lessons which is super fun!<br/>
<br/>
Cheesecake Heaven:<br/>
Sister Winchester took us to lunch after coming out with us this week in the rain! Ha she was such a trooper! She spoiled us by taking us to this cute cafe called Cheesecake Heaven. My Lemon Poppyseed slice was divine. I've got to admit I'm a big Cheesecake fan these days Mom... sorry for always whining before(;<br/>
<div>
<br/>
Exchanges with Winnebago YSA:<br/>
Sister Lamprecht came here with me while Sister Elkington went to the YSA Neenah/Appleton area with Sister Gifford. Sister Lamprecht is so stinkin cute and so great at relating with people. As we were pulling up to Jamie's for a lesson there were some people wearing skirts/suits and Sister Lamprecht was like, "are they Mormon?" We pulled up and it was Sister Pope and her parents! They came back for the baptism of a girl Sister Pope had taught in Milwaukee and then drove up to Green Bay that night to come to the lesson with us! It was such a fun surprise and so great to see her(:<br/>
<br/>
Surprise Visit:<br/>
Elder Martino and Elder Scott of the seventy visited the Green Bay 2nd Ward this week! They both spoke in sacrament meeting and brought such a strong spirit. Elder Scott talked about the importance of the Sabbath Day. Elder Martino talked about how he had felt inspired to come to Green Bay and had planned this unexpected visit. He said he came because this stake has great potential for growth! He challenged the members to become more converted themselves and to reach out to those around them. It was an inspiring meeting. I am so grateful to be here and hope I can be doing my very best to contribute to this growth in Green Bay! We are excited to work with the members building off of Elder Martino's counsel!<br/>
<br/>
Love and miss you, but I am so pumped about the work here in Green Bay! Things are good, I am learning and growing so so much. I know the Savior lives and the power of His Atonement is real!<br/>

</div><h1>So This Week Happened.</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-7969316763468212000" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>This week has been a blur, ha so many crazy things! Honestly so much has happened I just can't even begin to explain it all so I guess it's going to be one of those stories for after the mission.. But I will try to fill ya in on a few things. On Wednesday morning we finished getting Sister Pope all packed and sent her off on her way! Sister Wright, Sister Dunlap, and I waited at transfer point with the Elders until the transferring missionaries made it up to Green Bay. Sister Elkington and I got together and immediately started talking about everybody in Wisconsin Rapids - we've been talking about Rapids nonstop since. Ha it is so fun that we both had the chance to serve there! Sister Elkington brought a few letters for me from people there which was the absolute best, love them!<br/><br/>Lori's Confirmation:<br/>So backing up a bit, on Sunday, Lori was confirmed by Brother Sieber! Her confirmation was truly beautiful. She said she felt like she had butterflies pouring from her heart because she felt the spirit so<br/>strong(: I love that in the confirmation blessing the words are, 'receive the Holy Ghost' and that it is our choice to receive it or not. Even after we are baptized and confirmed we make that choice each day as we choose to do things that invite the spirit and help us to be in tune!<br/><br/>Sister Pope's Last Day:<br/>We were still low on miles so we were having the time of our lives busing and biking around(: Ha it was an adventure for sure. We had some solid lessons on Sister Pope's last day here and were able to say goodbye to Jamie and Lori. We had a lesson with Lori and her husband Steve to talk about everything after the baptism and confirmation.<br/><br/>Sister Elkington:<br/>Okay the last few days have been wonderful! I love Sister Elkington already and am so so grateful for a loving Heavenly Father who is allowing us to spend her last transfer together! I have felt so confident that Heavenly Father loves me and is aware of me this week - through the craziness there have been so many tender mercies and being companions with Sister Elkington is definitely one of those! We set some great transfer goals during our weekly planning and received some revelation during Mission Leadership Council about how to help the work progress here and help the sisters we exchange with. It was exciting to hear about the mission wide success we've been seeing and to plan ways to untie as a mission more! This transfer is jam packed and I cannot wait to get to work!<br/><br/>Crazy Connections:<br/>This week we received a couple referrals we are extra super stoked about! Kendall, a recent convert I taught in Madison texted us about her Uncle moving back into the Green Bay area. Turns out he had been in Utah and had met with the Provo Sisters 3 times and they had set a baptismal date for him! He just moved back to Green Bay so we reached out to him to set up a time to meet together. While we were talking on the phone we realized that I had met him in person at Kendall's baptism in December and now we are going to be working with him!!! Also a former I had contacted while in Madison just moved to Green Bay and we have an appointment set up with her for tonight - so crazy that all these connections are being made up here!<br/><br/>I know our Savior lives and loves us, how grateful I am for the chance to share this knowledge everyday! Hope you all have a wonderful week,<br/><br/><div>
love you!<br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:</div>

</div><h1>Fruit Ninja Warriors!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-3109310994194182355" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>Did you get to see the moon eclipse thing last night? We were at Jamie's for one of her new member lessons with the Mills and we sat outside watching it for a few minutes - so sweet! I'm sure Zach took pictures so I look forward to seeing those(:<br/><br/>Exchanges with Green Bay 1:<br/>So this week was good! We went on our first exchange of the transfer with GB1. I went to GB1 with Sister Adams-Hart while Sister Payne held down the fort here in GB2 with Sister Wright. While in the car Sister Adams-Hart and I listened to 'You Were Born to Lead, You Were Born for Glory' by Sister Sheri Dew. It is such an incredible talk! It totally pumped us up for all the tracting and contacting we did. We visited this former and had an awesome conversation with her! She said she had been thinking about baptism a lot after she stopped meeting with the missionaries and that her member friend had been reaching out to her as well. We set a return appt with her and are hopeful to see her progress!<br/><br/>Strength of the Youth:<br/>Ahh Mariah is progressing so so well(: Her baptismal date is all set for October 14th - we are doing it Wednesday night as the youth activity so all of the young men and young women in the ward can be there! In our lesson at the Ross's yesterday Mariah kept talking about how excited she is for her baptism so she can have a fresh new start - how wonderful it is that we can all have a fresh new start each week as we recommit and renew our baptismal covenants through the Sacrament(: Ah we are so excited for her! This week we had a couple lessons in the Ross's home, one at the Rau's, one at the church with a bunch of the young women - it is amazing to see how all the youth have come together to fellowship her! It has been such a sweet experience to hear the simple yet powerful testimonies of the youth out here. They are incredible! This week was also our week to go out with the YW for less active visits. We went with the Mia Maid group and had a great visit/short lesson with one the less active girls in their class. It is so fun to see how the youth are getting so into missionary work here(:<br/><br/>Fruit Ninja:<br/>We used this giant sword thing to chop up cucumbers and bananas. It was real life fruit ninja. BEST. THING. EVER.<br/><br/>My GB2 Peeps:<br/>I could just rave for hours and hours about the members here. Seriously, soo many good people. There has been a huge focus in the mission to work with the members so we have member lessons and lessons in member's homes as much as we possibly can! We've been so blessed in this area to have such missionary oriented members who are willing to help us out. This week we had a fun general conference prep lesson with the Cook family which was a blast! Then we had dinner with the Vanderhydens last night which is always such a treat - I've had so many spiritual experiences sitting around their blue kitchen table! Last night the message was on prophets and we were all able to share our testimonies. I am so grateful for a living prophet who testifies of Christ, giving us guidance and direction!<br/><br/>Interviews and Women's Conference:<br/>Highlights of the week include interviews with President Cutler and the Women's General Broadcast! Ahh how I love interviews! They always come at the perfect time. It was so nice to be able to talk with President Cutler and get the guidance and direction I needed. I am so excited for these next few months!!! Also the Women's Conf. was grand. Always a bit cheesy, but this time for some reason it was projected with an ASL interpreter and the interpreter for President Uchtdorf's talk was a character! Ha he was getting suuuuper into it. So so funny. Ha but the Women's conference messages about living the gospel joyfully and finding happiness in our journey were so great!<br/><br/>Oh and this old lady kissed me on the cheek this week, ha good times(: Well I'm super excited for conference and to hear/see Dan sing Saturday afternoon! Hope you all have a wonderful conference weekend! LOVE YOU!!!<br/><br/>xoxo,<br/>Sister Kelley(:

</div><h1>Getting in the House</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-634476564421904741" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends.<br/><br/>This week it was Sister Payne's 10 month mark and all she's been talking about for the last week and a half we've been together is about how much she loves cinnamon rolls and how she could really use<br/>one. SO... I made up a cinnamon roll recipe thing and went for it! Ha they weren't even half bad! We had fun delivering them to people(:<br/><br/>3 Important Things:<br/>So in Preach My Gospel there's this quote from President Hinckley about three important things a recent convert (and I think it applies to anyone in the church!) needs: 1) a friend in the church 2) a responsibility, a calling 3) nourishment by the word of God. It's been about a month and a half now since Jamie and Lori were baptized so we've made it our focus to make sure they are getting these three things. This week Lori was set apart to help out with family history and a calling was extended to Jamie! They have both made good friends in the ward and are keeping up with their scripture study. It has been such an incredible opportunity to see them learn and grow these past few months! It's fun to see how much they have changed as they've applied the Atonement of Jesus Christ. This week we were talking with Lori about all the changes she's made since learning about the church<br/>and it suprised me when she said she had seen me grown and change during this time as well. Sometimes it is hard to see our own growth, but as we do our best to consistently follow the Savior we are changed!<br/><br/>Porch Prayer:<br/>We stopped by to see Ashley this week, but she wasn't home. Instead her husband Gabriel answered the door and we were able to have a great conversation with him and even pray with him on their porch! It is such a blessing he is so supportive of Ashley, but we really hope we can help him see how the gospel can change his life as well! Obviously we want them to be an eternal family!(:<br/><br/>Getting Through the Door:<br/>This week we had dinner with the Clark family and all the Elders. It was super fun to share mission experiences and hear more about Brother Clark's mission. He was giving us some pointers on how to go from just teaching lessons on the doorstep to teaching lessons in people's homes. It was super funny and the next day when we were out tracting we tried it and actually got into someone's home! Ha it was super great and now we have this solid new investigator mom and son.<br/><br/>Quick Overview:<br/>All in all it was a decent week - we had a birthday party for a less active in a member's home, organized youth fellowshipping at volleyball, got in contact with a less active guy (who had been MIA) because Sister Payne understands Ham radio, got soaking wet when we forgot our umbrellas out tracting, sneakily stopped by at a member's when their non-member daughter-in-law was visiting, set a solid baptismal date with Mariah, ya know the usual missionary stuff(: Honestly I was having a bit of a hard time, but it's amazing what scripture study and prayer can do for a person! Ha I am feeling humbled and more motivated about life so things are good(: Also we had a miracle moment when this less active we have been working with for forever, came to church unexpectedly! Her visiting teacher sat with her and helped her feel comfortable and loved, it was so perfect!<br/><br/>We've been loving the changing fall leaves and the slightly cooler weather - hope you're enjoying it too(: It was super fun to hear you were able to help Kendall out with family history stuff - I love her!<br/>I am so grateful for the chance I had to meet her in Madison, missions are the best! I am so grateful for the chance to be a little part of this great work! LOVE YOU!!!<br/><br/>xoxo,<br/>Sister Kelley(:<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><h1>Improper fractions and the first three discussions</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-2203639867915499240" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>This week has FLOWN by. I know I say that every week, but seriously. The time is flying! Transfers are always busy so I'll chalk it up to that. It was crazy getting Sister Elkington all packed up, but such a fun time too(: Her last proselyting lesson was SO powerful. We drove out to Denmark to meet with Mariah and her little brother Daylan to teach them to pray often. Mariah was able to share her testimony about prayer with her younger brother and help teach him how to pray - the spirit was so thick in their little kitchen. Such a tender experience(: Saying goodbye to Sister Elkington was tough - I miss that girl! But on Wednesday Sister Payne arrived and she's hilarious so we have a good time(:<br/><br/>Word of Wisdom:<br/>This week we had some great lessons with our investigator Ashley. She has been having a mini family scripture study in the morning with her boys before they get off to school, she is so great!(: We taught her the Word of Wisdom this week and had Sister Winchester come as our member present. Sister Winchester was able to bear powerful testimony from the experiences of her son and by the end of the lesson Ashley said she felt the Word of Wisdom was true and committed to give up coffee! We're having a lesson with their family in the Mill's home tomorrow night and can't wait!<br/><br/>Working with the Young Women:<br/>We've been working with Sister Ross, the YW's President, to start this new thing where we go out with the young women once a month to visit some of the less active young women and leave them with a short spiritual thought. For the YW activity this week we met with the girls to discuss our game plan and how we can help these inactive YW feel loved - it turned out really well and is something I am super excited about!<br/><br/>Math Help and the Restoration:<br/>We had an awesome Restoration lesson with Alejandra, an investigator we tracted into a couple weeks ago and have been helping to learn more about God and Jesus Christ. She has been praying and reading the Book of Mormon so when we taught the Restoration again she really understood it and was excited! She also asked if we'd help her with some math homework so we went over when her husband would be home so he could watch the kids and we could help her with math, but when we got there her husband put their little girls in their room so he could ask us about the things we'd shared with his wife. As I sat and helped Alejandra with improper factions, Sister Payne sat with Jerrardo and taught the first three discussions! He was asking so many sincere questions, the spirit was exploding into our math session. I have never felt the spirit so strongly while doing math problems. Ha it was SO sweet! As Alejandra and I finished the math assignment, she turned to me and began asking about baptism and how she could prepare to be baptized. It was THE coolest thing. We said a kneeling prayer all together at the end and there was no denying the spirit was there. Both Alejandra and Jerrardo recognized it. Sister Payne and I got in the car and were talking about it non-stop till we went to bed(:<br/><br/>De Pere a dud? Think again!:<br/>Earlier in the week we used a bunch of miles to drive out to De Pere, but our appointments cancelled so we were feeling pretty bummed and annoyed we'd wasted our miles. We were really trying to be lead by the spirit as we contacted potentials and visited less actives, but NO ONE was home. Then we were driving along and we saw this less active we haven't been able to get in contact with for weeks! We parked and ran over to her and were able to talk for almost an hour. Such a tender mercy. Then we street contacted some people near there and met this solid couple, Ace and Rachel. They do a lot of self study from the Bible and listened as we explained the Book of Mormon. We shared a copy with them and have been texting back and forth about it with Rachel since then. We're really hoping they come to church Sunday!!! We felt so blessed it ended up being a good day in De Pere.<br/><br/>The Grass Cliff:<br/>I'm not sure if I've written home about the grass cliff or not, but we're taking care of a member's non-member mother's lawn trying to do service and teach her a bit and she has a HUGE grass cliff we attempt to mow. This week the elders came over to help because it was growing out of control! They tied a rope to this push lawn mower and lowered it down the cliff then pulled it back up again and repeated all the way down. I'm not sure if you're getting the mental image here or not, but it was hilarious and we all died laughing. Joan, the sassy 74 year old lady we're helping got a real kick out of it and absolutely loves us all(:<br/><br/>Stir Fry and Priesthood Blessings:<br/>The Vanderhydens had us and the English Elders over for dinner last night - it is always such a treat to go over there(: They made this delicious stir fry and we had a great discussion about Priesthood blessings. We went around the table sharing experiences we've had receiving or witnessing the power of a priesthood blessing and how faith was a key component in those experiences. I am so grateful the Priesthood has been restored to the earth and that we all are able to receive those blessings as we exercise faith and ask!<br/><br/>I am so so grateful to still be here in Green Bay. There are so many good things going on right now and we're seeing so many miracles! I am so grateful for the opportunity to serve as a full-time missionary, I love this work! Keep helping the missionaries back home and praying for opportunities to share the gospel(: Well we're off to go frisbee golf with some of the zone, hope you all have a wonderful week! LOVE<br/>YOU!!!!<br/><br/>xoxo,<br/>Sister Kelley(:

</div><h1>Sister Elkington's Last Week</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-1566487000983689661" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/>
<br/>
Oh man this week has been INCREDIBLE! Seriously so many good things. Oh and you're all probably wondering about transfer info so we found out on Saturday that I'll be staying here in Green Bay 2 and Sister Payne will come STL with me! Sister Elkington is headed to the mission home tomorrow and then flies back home Thursday. I sure am going to miss her, this transfer has flown by way too quick! I am excited to serve with Sister Payne though, we've been on exchanges together and get along great!<br/>
<br/>
Ross Family FHE:<br/>
This week we had our investigator Mariah over at the Ross home for family home evening! We taught about keeping the Sabbath day holy and we used the ice cream sundae object lesson. It was a big hit! The Ross family has been such a huge help to us this transfer with teaching Mariah. She feels comfortable there and can recognize the spirit in their home. It's also been a huge blessing to have Gunnar (the Ross's oldest son who got back from his mission earlier this year) and Alexa (Gunnar's wife) come to lessons with us and help. They are both returned missionaries and are so missionary minded! They got married this week and everything turned out wonderfully for them(:<br/>
<br/>
Green Bay ZTM:<br/>
Zone Training Meeting went super well, but we were almost late because the GPS rerouted us to this random road. We scared the Zone Leaders a little, but made it on time in the end(: As always it was fun to see the other missionaries from the zone and hear how things have been going. There are so many miracles happening throughout the mission right now and we are working toward our mission goal! It's been so neat to see the mission unite with the special Atonement quick read we're doing of the Book of Mormon. ZTM was all about the Holy Ghost and using Family Home Evening as a missionary tool. Sister Elkington and I lead the FHE training and it turned out super well! We did an FHE role play with an object lesson and a treat, everyone seemed to enjoy it(:<br/>
<br/>
Exchanges with Manitowoc:<br/>
This week Sister Lyons came up to Green Bay for the day while Sister Elkington spent the day in Manitowoc with Sister Peterson. Sister Lyons has a lot of health struggles, but she's such a good teacher. We were able to teach some really solid lessons together. We also met this neat lady named Flo who we chatted with on her driveway for almost an hour. At the end of our conversation we prayed together for her son who is struggling right now and after she was in tears. It was such a tender mercy to be placed in her path this week, 'right place, right time' missionary moments like these are my favorite. Just goes to show how mindful Heavenly Father is of His children(: Another miracle from our exchange was a lesson we had with our investigator Ashley in the Stephens home. Sister Stephens dropped everything to have her over. The members here are rock stars!<br/>
<br/>
Porch Scene:<br/>
One of my favorite moments of this week was when we went to Mariah's house for a lesson. She lives in very humble circumstances, and life at home isn't the easiest, but she is just so wonderful! We ended up having a lesson on her porch, with her brother and his friend and her two sisters. We were all scrunched up on the little porch together, but it was one of my favorite mission moments. Mariah just has such a desire to follow Christ, and it was so fun to see her teach her brother how to pray, and to see how much she has grown. This whole transfer, Sister Elkington and I have been praying for a baptism, and that night Mariah told us she wants to be baptized before Sister Elkington leaves. We have more to teach her yet, but for us that was truly and answer to our prayers. She won't be baptized before Sister Elkington goes, but she will very soon. We're so thankful for that answered prayer.<br/>
<br/>
Randomly Recognized:<br/>
So usually people think we're nuns, but this week we had a couple random guys recognize us a missionaries! We were out tracting and we talked to this guy who wasn't really interested, but a few minutes later we were walking back to our car when suddenly this barefoot guy came running over to us saying 'hey, are you Mormon missionaries?!' Turns out his dad came in after talking to us and casually mentioned we'd stopped by, he had studied with missionaries in Milwaukee and ran out to see if we knew the Elders he had been taught by. We had a great conversation with him and he kept saying Mormons are the nicest people he knows, ha so that was fun. Then today we met a member from the Fuji islands who is here playing in a reggae band this weekend! So sweet!<br/>
<br/>
Ashley's Answer:<br/>
Another highlight of the week was when our investigator Ashley told us she got an answer about the Book of Mormon! She has been reading it and praying about it since we've been meeting, then this week she had an amazing experience. She read the 'How Can I Know' section of one of the pamphlets we had given her and she asked Heavenly Father to help her recognize a sign of if what we have been teaching her is true. She felt impressed to open up her Bible and she turned to Isaiah 66:20 and read it and got her answer! She recognized the subtle promptings of the spirit and knows this is the right thing for her(: As she was telling us about her experience I couldn't help but think how she had such pure intent to know, so neat(:<br/>
<br/>
Lost and Found?<br/>
The first week I was in the mission field a woman named Barb (taught by the Elders) was baptized in Wisconsin Rapids. While I was serving in Rapids the sisters began teaching her the new member lessons so Sister C and I would go over there and help her out. Sister Elkington eventually worked with her too, but Barb moved to Green Bay and she lost contact. BUT now we are all in Green Bay so Sister Elkington and I did a bit of searching and were able to find Barb! Her face when she saw us both standing on her doorstep was PRICELESS. We had such a fun time talking with her again(:<br/>
<br/>
Oshkosh Road Trip:<br/>
We took an unexpected road trip to Oshkosh this week for Sister Elkington's final interview with President Cutler. I sure am going to miss her, it has been such a blessing to serve together. She is a hard working, obedient missionary. We've seen a lot of miracles together! I'm grateful for her example of finishing her mission strong, she's a wonderful example and friend!<br/>
<br/>
Simple Prayers:<br/>
This week we kept meeting solid spanish families! The elders are loving all the referrals(: I am so grateful for the little bit of Spanish I know so we can talk a bit and pray with them. I can't say very much when I pray in Spanish, but the simple prayers we've said on doorsteps this week have been powerful. It is so neat that Heavenly Father hears and answers ALL of His children.<br/>
<br/>
Fast Sunday Miracles:<br/>
We fasted as a mission - such a cool experience. We are so grateful for the success we are seeing here! This week Ashley came to church with her boys and a less active we've been working with for a couple months came for the first time in years! Such a wonderful day!(:<br/>
<br/>
Labor Day:<br/>
Yesterday we had a prime proselyting day! Some highlights were teaching a lesson about the Sacrament to Ashley, Gabriel, and their oldest boys Gabriel and Luis. The little boys are so sincere in their desire to learn more about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Little Gabriel asked how Jesus's suffering covered people's sins who lived before/after He was born. We talked about how Christ's Atonement is infinite - as we explained the Atonement simply the spirit filled their living room and little Gabriel was smiling so big(: We contacted a head quarter referral who was home and expecting us, it was great to teach her about the Book of Mormon. We ate dinner at the Dodson's and got to talk with their foreign exchange student Calo who is from Italy. We invited him to church Sunday so hopefully he'll come(: Then to top off a good day when a sketchy appointment with a potential fell through we felt prompted to stop by this potential family's home and they were there! We had an incredible lesson about prayer and at the end Alejandra said she is excited to learn more and to try praying everyday! We are so grateful to have met this family and we're excited to teach them!<br/>
<br/>
I am so grateful to be a missionary and so grateful to be here in Green Bay! I know this is truly Heavenly Father's work, He leads it! Hope you all have a wonderful week, LOVE YOU!!!<br/>
<br/>
xoxo<br/>

Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>Oh man this week has been a crazy one! Even though I've only been here for a few days - it is so so obvious how well Heavenly Father knows me and knows just what I needed for my last couple transfers! I am so excited to work in the Winnebago YSA Branch and the Neenah Ward. There are good things to come here, I can just feel it! We don't have any solid investigators so we're doing a lot of finding right now, but already we found a couple solid families and got some YSA referrals!<br/><br/>Leaving Packerland:<br/>Oh man the beginning of this week was absolutely insane as we tried to get all my stuff packed up and say goodbye to people. I was so grateful we were able to have one last FHE at the Ross's with Mariah. She is just so special(: I was also grateful for a final lesson with Lori and Sister Winchester - those two are such good friends now and have taught me so much over the past few months! Lori's kitchen table has become sacred ground to me, we've had so many incredible spiritual experiences there. I sure do love them both! We were also able to say goodbye to the Vanderhydens, Bytheways, Mills, Petersons, and Durans - some of the amazing Green Bay member families who helped us out with our missionary work a ton! We had some great lessons with our investigators Joan, Alejandra, and Ashley - even set a baptismal date! Oh then this super awesome lunch appointment with the Slattebos and their non-member daughter-in-law who has been a potential we've worked on for a while! We were able to teach her the Restoration and have such a good conversation together. Even though Sister Payne and I were exhausted from our crazy weekend we were so grateful for the miracles we saw(: It was hard to say goodbye to her as well - I know she will take care of Green Bay and do great things!<br/><br/>Menasha aka Metrasha:<br/>So our area is HUGE! Ha we cover the YSAs from as far north as Green Bay to as far south as West Bend. I hope miles will permit to drive up to Green Bay and try to contact some of the YSAs up there! We live in Menasha though and do most of our work near Menasha, Neenah, Appleton, and Oshkosh. Menasha is a cute little place, but they've got a paper mill and it reaks! Ha it makes me flash back to my days in Wisconsin Rapids - it's funny I would start and end my mission with that stench. Ha good times(: But really the place is beautiful, especially with all the fall leaves peaking! We've spent lots of time out knocking doors and getting to know the YSAs. We're trying to get more member work going on so we coordinated with our branch mission leader about that which was super helpful! Our branch mission leader just got back from his mission so he knows exactly what we need - we had the best correlation meeting ever yesterday and we all left feeling pumped and ready to baptize the world(: Oh a little tender mercy happened Sunday when I ran into Brother Allen (the assistant ward mission leader from Madison) and his family who moved into the Neenah ward a few months ago! It was fun to reconnect with them(: Another tender mercy was meeting this super solid lady named Allison - we have high hopes for her! Keep her in your prayers! Oh and Sister Hansen is just the cutest thing. I'll have to tell you more about her next week(:<br/><br/>Aw man I ran out of time, but just know we're doing well out here and learning lots(: I am so grateful for my loving Heavenly Father and my Savior Jesus Christ! I am grateful for the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon and the peace and hope it brings. I know this is our Father's work! Hope you all have a great week and a Happy Halloween!<br/>LOVE YOU!!!<br/><br/>xoxo,<br/>Sister Kelley(:<br/>Alma 37:34

I am so so sad to leave Green Bay. I am so grateful for the time I have been able to spend here and for those I have had the opportunity to meet. I know it is time for some stretching and growth though so I am excited for the new transfer ahead! We found out today I will be going to the Appleton Zone which means I have served in every zone in the mission except Milwaukee! So I'm going there to the Winnebago YSA ward which meets in Neenah. My new companion's name is Sister Hansen and I'll be finishing her training and keep doing STL stuff. Not sure how that will all work out, but the Assistants said President would explain it all... so we'll see!<br/>
<br/>
Appleton Exchange:<br/>
Went on an exchange with Sister Trent this week while Sister Payne stayed in Green Bay with Sister Rosenblum. Sister Trent goes home in just a few days so it was fun to be together and try to get the most of all her mission knowledge! We had a good day together and invited one of their investigators to be baptized. Then we did service for this older couple and they gave us some spaghetti squash, but we had walked a ways to their house so we were just walking around Appleton with a giant squash till we got to the car. Ha then we discovered we both love pumpkin so for lunch we splurged and got Great Harvest pumpkin chocolate chip bread to go with our spaghetti squash mmm(:<br/>
<br/>
A Joyous Reunion:<br/>
Kendall was in Green Bay this week so we met up at the church for a bit - ah it was so great to see her! It is incredible how much she has grown(: I am so grateful for the chance to know her and for her love and support! Such a tender mercy to see her!<br/>
<br/>
Mariah's Baptism:<br/>
Wow, what a special baptism! The spirit was so incredibly strong and the place was PACKED! Mariah had so much support, it was wonderful. The baptismal program was completely youth lead - the youth were in charge of all the music, the talks, the actual baptism and witnessing, EVERYTHING was done by the youth. We sang 'As Zion's Youth in Latter-days' as the closing hymn. It was awesome! There was a really special musical number done by Michela and Janna - they sang A Child's Prayer and I don't think there was a dry eye in the house. I just wanted to save that moment and stay there forever, the spirit was so so strong(: The youth here are incredible. They have all been such a big part of Mariah's conversion. I've never seen Mariah so happy, you could tell she felt so loved(: Sister Elkington and Gunnar and Alexa Ross even got permission to Skype in from Idaho! Her parents and siblings who aren't active at all were there and her very faithful sick Grandma was there too. Her grandma, Sister Micolichek spoke on Sunday after her confirmation and bore her testimony - it was so powerful! Mariah couldn't stop smiling and said she could definitely feel a difference when they said 'receive the Holy Ghost' - I am so happy I was able to be here for her baptism. I know she will be such a light and strength to her family and friends. We are now teaching her little brother and her Mom has invited us over to teach the family!<br/>
<br/>
LOVE YOU!!!!!!!<br/>

Dear fam and friends.<br/><br/>Where is the time going? It blows my mind that we get the transfer text Saturday, YIKES! This week was crazy exhausting. We had a Blitz with Marquette and an exchange with Sheboygan - so many miracles!<br/><br/>ZTM Celebration:<br/>So first off. Zone Training Meeting went off without a hitch. It was fun to celebrate fulfilling the mission goal and to hear about some of the miracles that have occurred in the last 3 months throughout the mission. Sister Payne was super nervous for her first training, but she was a total natural! The training we gave was originally given by Sister Renlund when she and Elder Renlund visited Wausau a couple weeks ago. It was all about teaching, testifying, promising blessings, and following up with a focus on the invitations we extend. Another great part of ZTM was when Lori came and bore her testimony and told her conversion story. It was SO powerful!<br/><br/>Marquette Blitz:<br/>The drive to and from Marquette was rainy, but the overcast day made the fall colors even more vibrate (if that is even possible!!!). It was a long drive, but so so beautiful! Pictures just don't do the UP justice. WOW. Really that's all I can say - fall is in full swing up there and will peak here in a couple weeks. I love the fall time(: Also it was super fun to blitz with Sister Twitchell again. Already she has grown so much and become a more confident missionary. We prayed Heavenly Father would put prepared people in our path and He totally did! We were contacting a potential when we met this totally prepared woman named Amber! We talked with her for almost an hour and were able to set a return appointment with her and give her a copy of the Book of Mormon. Amber reminds me so much of Jenny Grunden in Rapids it is insane! If she is anything like Jenny there will be such good things happening in Marquette(:<br/><br/>Lighting the Fasting Torch:<br/>For the next 3 months we are doing this super cool fasting chain throughout the mission. We started it this week with a mission-wide fast and then everyday for the next 90 days there will be a companionship fasting for the end of year mission goal we're working towards!<br/><br/>Sheboygan Exchange:<br/>Sister Straight and I went on an exchange together here in Green Bay this week - probably one of the most miracle filled exchanges I have gone on! We worked hard and had so much fun! We got 3 new investigators and had a bunch of other lessons and a couple member presents. It was just a good day all around. The biggest miracle was with a potential who called and set an appointment up with us! The other day when Sister Payne and I had been tracting we met this man who said he had a friend named Marleen who could use some help. When we asked more about meeting with her, he said he would give her our card. Most of the time when that kind of thing happens we never hear back, but MIRACLE he did give her the card and she reached out to us and wants to meet! We are excited to be teaching this new FAMILY!!!(:<br/><br/>Upcoming Baptism:<br/>Mariah passed her baptismal interview yesterday and is soo ready for her baptism on Wednesday. The youth are doing everything for the baptism - everything! It has been so fun to coordinate with them and see them get excited(: This week we had a lesson at the Rau's and at the end Johan (he's a Priest who will be baptizing Mariah) and Mariah were able to practice the baptismal ordinance - it was the sweetest thing to watch(:<br/><br/>Well that's all I've got for ya! I am so grateful for the Book of Mormon - I know it to be the Word of God! It changes hearts, it's changing mine. I know Heavenly Father hears and answers our prayers. He is aware of us! I know the Savior lives! I love being able to testify of Him each day! Hope you all have a wonderful week. LOVE YOU!!!!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<br/><br/>Ponderizing Mosiah 27:26<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><h1>General Conference(:</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-5811341463817476715" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>General Conference RULES! Plus the fact that I got to see Dan singing on the big screen in the Saturday afternoon session just made the experience that much sweeter(:<br/><br/>Oshkosh Trip:<br/>Mission Leadership Council meetings are always so spiritually satisfying, but this time social satisfaction was met as well! Sister Escobar, Elder Merrill, and Elder McDurmott from my MTC district were all there! It was such a fun reunion for us(: I LOVE SISTER ESCOBAR. We just sat and talked the whole time, it was so so great! She's spent her entire mission down in the Milwaukee Zone and I've jumped zones from Wausau to Madison to Green Bay so we haven't seen each other much<br/>at all! It was fun to see how we'd both grown and become better missionaries. At MLC we counseled together about how we did with our goals from the last 3 months and what our vision is for the next 3 months. There are good things happening in the mission as individuals and families are being prepared to make covenants! I am so grateful to be a small part of it(:<br/><br/>Missionary Birthdays:<br/>Something fun we did this week was celebrate Elder Muller's birthday! Elder Muller is an elder from the Green Bay 2 ward serving out in Utah - we had dinner with his family on his birthday and celebrated(: It was super fun! We blew out candles and made a video with his little sisters, they are so excited for him to come home in a few months(:<br/><br/>General Conference:<br/>It was such a tender mercy to see Dan singing - it was so fun to point him out to everyone at the church(: I loved that they sang "I know that my Savior loves me" - I really like the line in the second verse that says 'Wrapped in the arms of my Savior's love' it makes me think of one of my favorite verses in the Book of Mormon (Alma 34:10-17) but especially verse 16 where it talks about Christs' arms of mercy. Also it was neat to see Elders Renlund, Stevenson, and Rasband get called. I had the<br/>chance to read over their last conference talks before the Sunday morning session and as I listened to them share their testimonies of the Savior I felt so strongly that they truly are called of God! Some of my favorite talks were given by Lawrence, Durrant, and Keetch. Here are a few of my favorite lines/insight from each of them...<br/><ul>
<li>Lawrence: 'Our Heavenly Father knows our divine potential. He rejoices every time we take a step forward.' and 'The Holy Ghost makes an ideal traveling companion.'</li>
<li>Durrant: 'Small efforts sustained over time can produce significant results'</li>
<li>Keetch: Becoming = true conversion of the heart</li>
</ul>
Also Elder Hale's talk was so so good! I am so grateful for living prophets and apostles and for personal revelation to guide our lives. I know our Heavenly Father is mindful of each of us and that He hears and answers our prayers! I look forward to implementing my conference inspiration!<br/><br/>Well that's all I've got for ya this week! Things are going great out here. I love the mission, I love Green Bay, I love my Savior Jesus Christ. How grateful I am for Him and His Atoning sacrifice. <div>

</div><h1>Happy Thanksgiving!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-8030985928871828092" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>Oh rats we really have no time to write today! Things have been crazy busy, but good news! We found out about transfers and Sister Hansen and I will be staying together(: We are both super excited about that and happy to keep working with the YSAs here. We are actually being put into a trio so Sister Dunlap will be transferred here to be an STL with me and we'll all get to work together for the next 4 weeks until I go home. I don't know anything about trios, but it should be an adventure! <br/><br/>Our Thanksgiving Adventures:<br/>We had a wonderful Thanksgiving, we were so well taken care of. We played football in the morning with the Neenah ward and got a few less actives and potential investigators to come! We had a turkey bowl tournament and then just tossed the football around saying things we're grateful for, it was a blast. We ate lunch at the Richards with our investigator George - we shared a message and used Alma 26:37 which I LOVE! Sister Richards made a pecan pie which was divine(: Then later we had a dinner appointment with the Graves. They took us and the Neenah Elders out to Golden Corral! I was totally stuffed by that point. At the restaruant we ran into some other members and had a fun time talking with them. Plus the Graves brought one of their son's friends (their son is currently serving a mission) with them so we got to get to know him and share a message! We then stopped in to see a less active and eat some pumpkin bars(: Then a final stop in for a lesson with the Stoehrs. We made gratitude turkeys with their little girls, sooo cute(: Anyway it was a great day - I am so grateful for the many blessings I have been given and how mindful Heavenly Father is of me! I am grateful for His divine plan, it truly is a plan for our happiness! I am grateful for the restoration, for a living prophet, and the power of the priesthood. I am grateful for the scriptures and the peace they bring - grateful I can speak to my Heavenly Father in prayer and receive personal guidance and direction. I am so grateful for such a wonderful family, for the support you are to me. I am grateful to be a missionary in Wisconsin!!!!!!!!!!!!!! God is good(:<br/><br/>Well that is really all I have time for, but we had a great exchange with the Appleton sisters and are getting things ready for Cassandra's baptism this week! Hope you all have a wonderful week! Thanks for the package and letters! LOVE YOU!!!!!!!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<div style="text-align: center;">

Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever driven so much in my life... Ha we spent a TON of time in the car this week, but despite the time we spent driving and the time we spent in meetings, we still got a ton of good work done! <br/><br/>Exchange in Fond du Lac:<br/>So we started off the week with an exchange in Fond du Lac. I spent the day with Sister Jenson down there while Sister Passey came up here to be with Sister Hansen. Sister Jenson reminds me a ton of Sister Schlosser. Though she's only been out for 11 weeks she is incredibly bold! We got in with a former to teach the first discussion and we extended a powerful baptismal invite. We also street contacted into this super cute YSA who has recently been looking for truth. We shared a copy of the Book of Mormon with her and got her info to follow up. I really hope the sisters can begin teaching her!<br/><br/>Mission Leadership Council in Milwaukee:<br/>After exchanging back with the Fond du Lac sisters we had a couple appointments and then hit the road again, this time heading to Milwaukee. We stayed overnight with Sisters Gross and Smeltzer in Milwaukee 1. Unfortunately we parked where we weren't supposed to... and now owe $10 to the city of Milwaukee.... UGHH. Ha and driving in Milwaukee was a JOKE! We left early the next morning to drive to the Milwaukee South Stake Center, but the traffic was so bad we were almost late for Mission Leadership Council! thankfully we arrived just in time and were able to go into the meeting with everyone else(: As always it was fun to see everyone, especially Sister Escobar and hear from President and Sister Cutler. Elder and Sister Schwitzer of the 70 joined us as well and Elder Schwitzer shared an inspiring training! A few fav insights include...<br/>- 'repentance is a form of restoration' <br/>- 'repentance is the key to gaining a testimony and receiving eternal life'<br/>- 'don't invite out of duty, invite out of love'<br/>- 'you can be the vehicle whereby miracles come to pass'<br/>- 'we are fishers of men and members are the best fish finders'<br/>- '3 P's of revelation: persue the facts, ponder the solution, pray for confirmation'<br/><br/>Contacting in West Bend:<br/>Since we were down in Milwaukee we decided to use our miles effectively and spend the day contacting in West Bend which is part of our area we don't get to very much. It was fun because we figured out a YSA I used to work with in Green Bay had moved to West Bend so we went to visit her and her Grandparents. <br/><br/>Mission Tour in Green Bay:<br/>The day after MLC we had Mission Tour in Green Bay with the Appleton, Wausau, and Green Bay zones! I got to see Sisters Payne and Schlosser again which was super fun! Plus a bunch of other mission friends. We got to hear from Elder and Sister Schwitzer and President and Sister Cutler and the APs. It was a great meeting - made us super pumped about our mission goal for the end of the year! I especially loved the special sister meeting Sister Schwitzer did in the morning. Again some of my fav insights:<br/>- 'be really good at being you'<br/>- 'the spirit doesn't dwell in a mess'<br/>- 'don't forget to sing! Especially at Christmas time'<br/>- 'You come from good stock. Hold you head up, pull your shoulders back. You can do hard things!'<br/>- 'convert don't convince'<br/>- 'once you invite a person to repent, you invite yourself to help'<br/><br/>Stake Conference in Appleton:<br/>The day before Stake conference President Kindt called and asked if I would speak. Ha so I got to speak in Stake Conference with President and Sister Cutler! So that was fun! I was a little nervous, but it all came together and turned out well. I used the classic lighthouse story with hymn #335 and talked about what members can do to invite their friends. It was a good stake conference. Some of my fav insights include:<br/>- 'conversion has no beginning and no end'<br/>- 'the Sabbath day is not my day, it is the Lord's'<br/>- 'life has a way of humbling you'<br/>- 'part of the natural man is the natural mind'<br/>- 'peace is less a reward and more an attribute'<br/><br/>Hope you have a Happy Thanksgiving this week! I am so grateful to be a missionary(: I'm grateful for each of you and incredibly grateful for the knowledge of this gospel! I am grateful for a loving Heavenly Father and for His Son. I LOVE YOU!!!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:

</div><h1>Is Not Easily Provoked...</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-807828444035734977" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/>
<br/>
This week has been good. Crazy, but good. I am loving the mission-wide study we are doing right now of 'The Living Christ.' Every week we are memorizing a new paragraph and studying a Christ-like attribute that corresponds with the paragraph. We're a couple paragraphs in and will end the last week of December. So this past week we were memorizing the second paragraph and studying charity. I love how charity is defined in the Bible dictionary as 'the highest, noblest, purest form of love' and the classic Moroni 7 'charity suffereth long...' Sister Hansen and I had a bunch of great comp study conversations about it and our catch phrase for the week was 'is not easily provoked' because a ton of unfortunate, annoying stuff happened, but we kept our cool or at least tried to(: <br/>
<br/>
Sheboygan Exchange:<br/>
Ah so the exchange with Sheboygan almost didn't happen because of the craziness going on, but I am so glad it all worked out because it was such a good exchange. I was with Sister Carlini again and Sister Hansen went to Sheboygan with Sister Koyle. I absolutely love these sisters! Sister Carlini and I have been going on exchanges together since the beginning of her mission (7 months ago!) so I have been able to see her grow a TON! She is such a sweetheart and we got some solid work done while we were together. We took a less active with us to visit another less active and they both totally needed the lesson we taught and after the lesson they came with us to have a Book of Mormon read with a recent convert and later to see our investigator Cassandra - ha everyone was getting into the missionary spirit, it was so fun! <br/>
<br/>
Pre-Thanksgiving Potluck:<br/>
Mmm we had this wonderful Thanksgiving dinner potluck with the branch after church yesterday. The food was great plus Cassandra was there and she brought a friend! His name is Danny. He was actually baptized into the church with his family when he was younger, but hasn't been to church in a long time. The YSAs did such a great job fellowshipping him and he said he'd be there again next week!<br/>
<br/>
This is the Lord's Work:<br/>
AH so I know this is the Lord's work, but really THIS IS THE LORD'S WORK! We had this cool miracle happen where we really felt like we had a small glimpse of Heavenly Father's plan for this area. It is super neat because this revelation has been received by us, President Cutler, President Munson, and the Appleton Stake President - all these pieces coming together just showing that the Lord is working with and inspiring each of us to do the work He wants done with the Winnebago YSA branch. I am so grateful to be here and be a part of it! There is so much growth to be had here, I can just feel it!!!<br/>
<br/>
Jaclyn's Referral:<br/>
So a couple weeks ago Jaclyn gave me this referral of her great Uncle Johnny and Aunt Teddy. They live pretty out of the way so we hadn't had time to contact them, but this week we had an appointment near their house so we dropped by to visit with them too! They were hesitant to talk with us at first, but when I explained that I had grown up with Jaclyn they got so excited and told us all about their family! They pulled out old pictures of Jeff and we looked through them and talked about families being together forever. It was awesome! Ha Johnny and Teddy are such good people! They agreed to let us come over one more time for a Christmas message in December(:<br/>
<br/>
DVD Miracle:<br/>
Last night we had this sweet miracle showing the member involvement DVD. I don't think I've mentioned the DVD too much, but it's something President Cutler has been pushing in the mission for a few months now. It's a 10 minute video of some recent converts sharing their conversion stories and how the gospel has blessed them. President has asked that we show it twice a week to members and less actives in all the units in the mission. Honestly it's super cheesy, but we always end up having a great discussion about our personal conversion and we're able to ask for referrals. We had only showed it once for last week when our appointment cancelled last night): BUT we followed a prompting to check up on this less active YSA and his Mom in Appleton and THEY WERE HOME! We got in with them and were able to show the DVD and have a great lesson. Josh committed to coming to church next week too! We were pumped! It is humbling to see the blessings come for following the counsel of your priesthood leaders - even when at first you are a little hesitant because the DVD is so cheesy...(: <br/>
<br/>
In other news... We're having toilet problems again. UGHHH. <br/>
<br/>
That's all I have time for! Hope you have a wonderful week(: Celebrate lots for the anniversary Mom and Dad! Thanks for being such great examples(: I am so grateful for each of you and for the support you are to me! I am incredibly grateful for my Savior, for His example and atoning sacrifice. I love being a missionary, I love Wisconsin, I love this work and of course, I LOVE YOU!<br/>
<br/>

</div><h1>The YSA Life</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-8056731571255789920" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>Oh man, time is going SO fast these days - since when is it Monday again?! Today is Sister Hansen's two month mark! My little trainee is growin up(: Since I'm only half training her I'm her step mom as far as the mission lingo goes, but since she was also trained by her cousin for a couple weeks after an emergency transfer with her original trainer, I am actually her 2nd step mom - so yeah her poor family tree is a little crazy(: But she is wonderful and since I don't think I've mentioned too much about Sister Hansen I'll try to fill you in a bit - she's from Salt Lake, she's 19, she LOVES kids and loves to talk(:, she was studying at the U before the mission, she is half Swedish, she loves Chinese food and she's 6 feet tall! She is such a sweet heart and so eager to jump in and learn. We're laughing all the time(:<br/><br/>YSA Work:<br/>We have a couple solid investigators that are now both on date, but we're working hard to find right now. We did have an incredible lesson with our investigator Cassandra this week where we were able to set a baptismal date! Cassandra is a member referral who has been studying with the missionaries off and on for almost 3 years. She has come a LONG way and is so sweet. She truly wants to change her life. She called us earlier in the week saying she'd been reading Enos and totally connected. We read through the chapter with her and felt the spirit soo strong in verse 27. AH the scriptures are just soo good(: <br/><br/>Toilet Explosion:<br/>Ugh. This week our toilet exploded during studies. And when I say exploded, I mean EXPLODED. Our bathroom floor was inches deep in toilet water... and since we only have a couple towels we had to sop up the water and wring out the towels in the bathtub. I've definitely done more pleasant things in my life. Ha ugh! Sister Hansen was dying laughing and sat writing in her journal about it, documenting the entire process. We made an epic video and after lots of scrubbing we have a clean bathroom once again! Phew!<br/><br/>The Branch Members:<br/>I could just go on and on for days about how incredible the branch members are here! They are SO good to us. It's humbling to see how they are each sincerely trying their personal best to live the gospel. Whether they are are preparing for missions, working, or going to school they make time to help us out. They really are so great. This week during a new member lesson with a recent convert named Alvin, he told us how much the gospel has changed his life and how he went for a church to THE church. AHH. A good chunk of the branch members are converts and they carry the branch. Not only do we have great branch members, but we're also lucky to have a stellar branch mission leader and assistant! Viking and Tyler are planning a mini MTC experience for the ward missionaries this week which will be great to help them catch the missionary spirit and know how to fulfill their callings. We are working hard to find new YSAs to teach and to get connected with some of the less active YSAs who live a little farther away.<br/><br/>Oshkosh Exchange:<br/>This week we had our first exchange with the Oshkosh Sisters, Sister Coley and Sister Lyons! They are both in our district so we get to see them a bunch which is fun(: They are both so sweet. So I spent the day in Oshkosh with Sister Lyons which was fun because we've been on quite a few exchanges together. The crazy thing is Sister Lyons grew up in Wisconsin and then moved out west and got her mission call to come back here! She is currently SERVING IN HER HOME WARD! How crazy is that?! We talked about ways she could reach out to her friends and invite them to learn about the gospel. We invited one of their investigators to baptism and happened to meet a couple less active YSAs! I am so excited we get to do exchanges so we can travel and meet with some of the YSAs (and hopefully their friends!!!) we wouldn't normally be able to see! <br/><br/>Sunday Miracles:<br/>Yesterday was so so good. We set a high member present lesson goal this week and were really trying to get out with the members, but we were still 2 MP lessons short when we went to church. At church though we were able to get 2 lessons set up and arrange for a couple of the branch members to come with us to each one! It was such an answer to prayer and made us super happy! Little moments like that just prove that Heavenly Father is soo aware of us and He respects our righteous desires! I am just so grateful for that and for our Savior! I know He lives!!!<br/><br/>Hope you all have a wonderful week! Thanks for the support and encouragement always(: LOVE YOU!!!!<br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley<br/>Enos 1:27<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><h1>Happy Halloween!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-4145049577798756377" itemprop="description articleBody">
<br/>
<br/>
Dear fam and friends,<br/>
<br/>
Happy late Halloween!! Hope you all had a wonderful week(:<br/>
<br/>
Blisters for days:<br/>
So lets see, this week my companion and I thought we had ran out of miles for the month (well actually enough miles for us to drive only 7 miles a day haha) so we decided that for that week we would be walking everywhere. This proved to be rather difficult. On Tuesday we had our district meeting in Oshkosh and that's what used up all our miles since it's 45 minutes away and we also went up to the university in Oshkosh so on Wednesday is when we began to trek ourselves everywhere. We decided to walk over to the Myers and drop off an invitation for the Neenah ward's Trunk or Treat event. While this is maybe a 10 minute drive, it somehow turned into an hour long walk, maybe 3 miles? (to be fair our GPS was malfunctioning for half the time and you know how awful I am with directions) After that we had an appointment with one of our investigators at 3:30 so at 1 we turned around and started the walk back in the opposite direction to Neenah. At about 3:00 we weren't even halfway there and we realized there was no way we were gonna make it on time so we called him and asked if we could push it to 4:30, which he thankfully said worked.  At 4 though we had walked 4 miles from the Meyer's and still were barely half way to our appointment.  Thankfully a member was able to pick us up at a gas station that we were able to find refuge in. Oh yeah, it was also raining and the bottoms of my shoes have holes in them... so wet feet and lots of walking made for some nasty blisters. Ha I think I'll have to retire my holey shoes!<br/>
<br/>
MTC Crew:<br/>
Friday was our Mission Leadership Council meeting, and since it was in Oshkosh we had to use our car and they were able to reimburse 30 out of the 38 miles that it took to get there.  So we were able to drive a little, but still were hurting for miles big time! Anyway MLC was as wonderful as ever - President and Sister Cutler are just so great(: It was fun to see Sister Payne again and a bunch of other mission friends. <br/>
<br/>
Branch Scavenger Hunt:<br/>
We had a branch activity scavenger hunt where we had to take pictures of ourselves and film us doing crazy things.  Some items on the list included playing patty cake with a stranger, serenading a stranger, and trying on the craziest outfit at walmart.  We had done all these things and more, and my companion and I were able to hand out some pass along cards and share a few short messages so it was a win win! Plus a bunch of less actives and recent converts we're working with showed up as well!<br/>
<br/>
Reverse Trick or Treating:<br/>
Saturday was H A L L O W E E N and that was a busy day indeed.  Another member was able to drive us to our appointment with our investigator Cherie (who showed up to church this Sunday woo!!) and be present for that lesson with her.  She was also able to drive us to a lesson with a recent convert, oh, she is a recent convert herself as well and we are absolutely obsessed with her. Her name is Karlene and she loves the Packers, just like everyone else here haha. Well she was able to drive us up to Appleton as well for a lesson we had scheduled with Alvin.  From there we met at a members house waiting for Alvin to arrive there and in the mean time sewed little puffs of cotton unto a shirt with the number 9 on it, if you can guess what the costume was you win.  Afterwards we left to go to bake cookies at a family's house from the Neenah ward and had a lesson with them and had dinner. Then took the treats around as a reverse-trick-or-treat(:<br/>
<br/>
Miles Mishap:<br/>
When we got home we calculated the miles we had used for the month. We were given 1125 miles and guess how much we had used... only 1076... that means we had close to 100 miles left that we could have used.  Long story short, pay attention in math class.  And the members here in Wisconsin are the most charitable service oriented people I have ever met.  To have so many members be willing to drag us around city to city, and to provide for us is such a humbling experience.  Even though this week has been crazy as ever, I know that the people here will always have our backs.<br/>
<br/>
Fasting Miracle:<br/>
Yesterday we were able to see a huge miracle where we had three of our investigators attend church and even a potential who had met with missionaries years ago and since hasn't been to church but felt the prompting to attend yesterday! His name is Clinton and I was able to talk and get to know him more and although we were unable to get his contact information, Sister Hansen and I are hopeful that we will see more of him in our future as we continue to be obedient and faithful, we have truly seen so many tender mercies and miracles through our mission fast and we are so thankful for the strength our Heavenly Father gives to us every day!<br/>
<br/>
LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
xoxo<br/>
Sister Kelley<br/>
<br/>
PS Huge highlight of the week was when Liz, one of the recent converts I got to teach in Rapids came back from school out at BYU Idaho and came to the YSA ward on Sunday! We got to see each other for a bit and it was THE BEST THING! Love her!<br/>

</div><h1>Last One!!!</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-992090903188614330" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>How do you sum up this whirlwind of emotions? Hmm.. I'm not quite sure. I guess I'll start by talking about what we did for Christmas...<br/><br/>Our Week of Christmas:<br/>We had a wonderful week spreading Christmas cheer throughout Appleton, Menasha, and Neenah. We went around caroling and bringing good tidings of great joy in the form of copies of the Book of Mormon(: We also took around cookies and treats to those we're teaching. We were well taken care of by kind members in the Neenah ward and YSA branch. It was so fun to see the fam and get to talk on Christmas day(: Plus meeting Sister Hansen and Sister Dunlap's families was a blast(: We used the nativity coloring set you sent and had some great lessons about ways we can invite the Savior into our lives and how we can make room for Him this coming year. I'm so grateful for the birth and life of our dear Savior and I hope I can celebrate and show my gratitude for Him each and every day!<br/><br/>Oh rats, now comes the tough part... How do you sum up 18 months in a paragraph?!<br/><br/>Final Paragraph:<br/>Talking about the waters of Mormon Alma wrote, 'how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer; yea, and how blessed are they, for they shall sing to His praise forever' (Mosiah 18:30). These past 18 months the state of Wisconsin has become my 'waters of Mormon' as I have come to a greater knowledge of my Redeemer. My relationship with my Heavenly Father has been strengthened as I've prayed and truly spoken with Him. I've understood Him speaking to me as I have searched the scriptures. The Book of Mormon especially has been KEY in strengthening my faith in and understanding of the Savior and His infinite Atonement. Consistently reading the Book of Mormon has changed my heart and brought me closer to Him. I've come to understand that not only can I be healed and cleansed through the power of the Atonement, but I can be enabled - given the power to BECOME. Through the miracle of repentance I can progress and become a little better each day. This gives me hope. Hope that because I've seen this work in my life it can and will work in the lives of those around me! As my understanding and testimony of the Atonement has increased, my desire to share it has as well! I've come to love teaching the Restoration - that a young boy with a sincere question was answered by our loving Father in Heaven. I know our humble prayers can be answered, that Heavenly Father speaks directly to us through personal revelation. His Priesthood is on the earth again today. This is His church. I testify that Jesus is the Living Christ. How grateful I am for the opportunity I've had and will continue to have to testify of Him.<br/><br/>AH it is so hard to describe all the emotions we've experienced in our little trio the last few days, but what I can share is that I know Heavenly Father is so keenly aware of each and every one of us. I am so grateful for the angels He has put into my life to support me through this incredible adventure. I've been so blessed to have amazing people in my different areas, wonderful companions, and such supportive family and friends at home! I can't wait to see you and HUG you!!!!(: Thanks for being such great examples to me and for the encouragement! I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><h1>Testifying of the Living Christ</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-5531363006591829943" itemprop="description articleBody">
Dear fam and friends,<br/><br/>Can you believe there are only 4 more days until Christmas?! Celebrating the birth, life, and perfect example of Jesus Christ is what Christmas is all about - and what missionary work is all about! I am so grateful for this opportunity to be a full-time witness of my Savior at this special time of year. I know He lives! I know that He leads His Church upon the earth today. I am so grateful for His loving concern for each person on earth and His willingness to suffer for our sins and support us in our trials, troubles, and afflictions. Words can't express the gratitude I feel for the gift of His marvelous Atonement. I know that the Book of Mormon has been given to the world to witness of Christ's Atonement and to help us know that His gospel and priesthood power are restored upon the earth. For the 12 days of Christmas we've made a special effort to give the Book of Mormon as a gift to all the families and young single adults we meet. We've seen some neat carol tracting miracles this week and have seen people's hearts be softened to accepting it!<br/><br/>Thanks for all the support and love! I hope this Christmas and always we can all help bring others to the Living Christ. "His way is the path to happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come. God be thanked for the matchless gift of His divine Son."<br/><br/>Merry Christmas! LOVE YOU!!!!!<br/><br/>xoxo<br/>Sister Kelley(:

</div><h1>Let it Snow...Please?</h1><div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-5921980642745237821" itemprop="description articleBody">
<br/>
Dear fam and friends,<br/>
So I understand there was a huge snow storm back home?! What is this?! Wisconsin is experiencing the mildest winter they've seen in over 100 years! I'm still only wearing one pair of tights and it is DECEMBER!!! It has been raining nonstop for the last few days and everything is gray and muddy. I miss the snow. Sister Hansen has been praying every night for a white Christmas and Sister Dunlap has been expressing her gratitude for the warmth... haha(:<br/>
<br/>
Appleton Zone Conference:<br/>
This week we had Zone Conference in Oshkosh - my very last one! It was such a good meeting. Sister Dunlap and I did our first and only training together. We taught about recognizing and addressing the concerns of those we teach. The assistants, zone leaders, and President and Sister Cutler all gave great trainings as well, but the highlight was the Christmas song medley we did! We sang (or some missionaries performed) all of the Christmas hymns and recited paragraphs of 'The Living Christ' between each hymn. It brought such a special spirit! Then I had the chance to give my departing testimony - I kept it together for the most part, but at the end we sang 'I Know the My Redeemer Lives' and I totally lost it. Ah the spirit was so strong!!! <br/>
<br/>
Other Adventures:<br/>
We met this older lady who needed help vacuuming so we went over to her house this week and were able to spend some time helping her out and teaching her about forever families. Later in the week we scheduled back to back appointments at the church so we sat there for a few hours with people just coming to us to be taught - ha it was sweet, but we were happy to go out and walk around that night! We had a lesson with a less active and she brought her non-member friend!!! We got to teach the Restoration and answer questions. <br/>
<br/>
Exchanges with Sheboygan:<br/>
Sister Koyle joined Sister Hansen and I here in Winnebago YSA for this exchange - it was a good time! We worked super hard and saw some sweet miracles. We got back in contact with this potential YSA named Alex. We had a great conversation with him and he accepted a Book of Mormon and wanted to read about the story of Alma the Younger. We also got this sweet referral for the Spanish elders and contacted a few of the referrals we had. Then later when we were driving this one house stuck out to us so we went back to knock it and met a Pastor and his family. We had a cool discussion with them and they accepted a Book of Mormon and invited us to their live nativity next week. Also Sister Koyle is stellar, she's going to be such an anchor for the mission.<br/>
<br/>
Oh one last thing - we started going carol tracting and it is straight fire! People love it! And being in the trio makes it less awkward because 3 voices&gt;&gt;&gt;2 voices. So yes. Success. We've been giving 'A Savior is Born' cards out like there's no tomorrow and so many 'gift' copies of the Book of Mormon! I am so grateful for this time to be serving as a full time missionary testifying of our loving Savior! As we rely on Him we won't make the difference, but we will BE the difference in the lives of those around us! We can truly be instruments in our Heavenly Father's hands at this time of the year and always(:<br/>
<br/>
LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!<br/>
xoxo<br/>

Dear fam and friends,<br/>
<br/>
Wow this weekend. WOW. That is all I can say. Ahh it was the craziest, most spiritually filling weekend ever. So many good things! Heavenly Father is SO SO SO keenly aware of each of us. It is so humbling! <br/>
<br/>
The Trifecta:<br/>
Everything for transfers went smoothly this week. We picked up Sister Dunlap in Oshkosh and have managed to fit all her stuff into the apartment with ours! I was honestly a little nervous for the trio just because it is something I haven't experienced and I've heard a few horror stories, but it is so great. We all get along super well and get work done! Teaching is the trickiest part - just figuring out how to involve everyone and not talk over each other, but we are getting a lot better at it. We have already seen some super cool miracles together! Sister Dunlap is from Reno, Nevada and she's a twin! Also she is half Filipino so I have one half Filipino companion and one half Swedish companion! Then there's me... full American? Ha but yeah Sister Dunlap is one of the kindest, sweetest, and most powerful missionaries I have met! I love serving with her and Sister Hansen!<br/>
<br/>
Cassandra's Baptism:<br/>
Ah I just can't explain everything that happened this week! There was so much opposition leading up to Cassandra's baptism, it was unreal. It seemed like everything that could go wrong did and yet everything came together on Saturday afternoon for one of the most spiritually uplifting baptisms I've attended. I know that is because of Cassandra's preparation and her righteous desires. It was amazing to see the physical change in her countenance as she came up out of the water. She kept saying how she felt so free and light, that all the heaviness in her heart was gone and that she was at peace. Her confirmation yesterday was equally beauitful and afterwards she couldn't stop smiling(: The branch totally embraced her and supported her through this trying week. I am so grateful for each of them and the many sacrifices they make to help lift each other. At the beginning of the baptism a few of the recent converts shared their testimonies and the spirit engulfed everyone there - like wow. So strong. I am so grateful for the ordinance of baptism for the covenant we can make and the blessings of the Father. He is over all. He hears and answers our prayers and carries us through!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all got a chance to watch the 1st Presidency Christmas Devo - we are listening to Christmas music non-stop and talking with everyone about the 'A Savior Is Born Video.' How grateful I am that our Savior was born! LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
xoxo<br/>
